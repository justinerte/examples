a new study claims  smokers can improve their life expectancy even if they kick the butt in their   s 
researchers at national institutes of health  nih  in the us also suggest that people aged    or older currently smoking were more than three times more likely to die than never smokers 
they reviewed data for more than         individuals aged    and over from the nih aarp diet and health study 
they completed a questionnaire in           detailing their smoking use  and reported deaths were tracked until the end of      
analyses conducted between      and      correlated age at death with self reported age at smoking initiation and cessation and amount smoked after    years of age 


the           questionnaire assessed smoking intensity in cigarettes per day and smoking history through nine age periods 
for this study  participants still smoking in their   s were identified as current smokers  and former smokers were classified by the decade of life when quitting 
at the beginning of the study              the median age of participants was    years  almost    per cent were former smokers and   per cent were current smokers 
males were less likely     per cent vs    per cent of females  to be never smokers  males smoked more than females       pack years vs      pack years   and males were more likely to have started smoking before    years     per cent vs     per cent of female smokers  
during an average follow up of     years  almost    per cent of the participants died  while      per cent of the never smokers died       per cent       per cent       per cent and      per cent of former smokers who quit between ages                      and       years died  respectively 

current smokers fared the worst  with      per cent dying  mortality rates for women were lower than men at each level of smoking use 
 ldquo these data show that age at smoking initiation and cessation  both key components of smoking duration  are important predictors of mortality in us adults aged    years and older  rdquo  said sarah h  nash  from nih 
the study was published in the american journal of preventive medicine
