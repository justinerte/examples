in trump’s america, ‘pizzagate’ could be the new normal - the washington post

i was home with my family sunday afternoon when an email arrived from a reader with a proposal  he wanted to lynch me 
   rope  tree  journalist     the man wrote     some assembly required     to this slogan  made popular by t shirts donald trump supporters wore at his rallies  my would be hangman added his offer     i will assemble for you    
this bit of  er  gallows humor was the latest  though far from the worst  of the sort of correspondence my colleagues and i have been receiving lately 
there was a time when threats against journalists  like threats of any sort of political violence  were exceedingly rare  but in trump   s america  such threats are neither rare nor idle 
if you doubt that  consider the events in recent days at comet ping pong  the family pizza place in northwest washington i   ve been frequenting with my daughter ever since she was a toddler a decade ago  lately  the owner and staff at comet     and those of other businesses on the block     have been getting death threats  spurred by radio host alex jones  a conspiracy theorist with close ties to the president elect 
jones has been whipping up a bogus and bizarre accusation that comet is a front for a hillary clinton affiliated pedophilia ring  and the resulting calls and messages threaten a    public lynching    of this nonexistent ring     i pray someone comes to comet pizza with automatic weapons and kills everyone inside     wrote one     i just may cut your throat            i truly hope someone blows your brains all over comet pizza    
comet   s owners asked the fbi for help but heard nothing in reply from james comey   s agents  they heard instead from a north carolina man  carrying an assault rifle  who walked into comet and started shooting on sunday afternoon     by coincidence  about the same time i got the email from the aspiring hangman  the man told police he had come to    self investigate    the pedophilia conspiracy  mercifully  nobody was hurt 
the notion that clinton and her aides are involved in pedophilia has been furthered by none other than michael flynn  the man trump tapped to be his national security adviser  on nov     flynn tweeted about allegations that clinton emails included evidence of    sex crimes with children     even after the man fired his assault weapon inside comet on sunday afternoon  flynn   s son  michael flynn jr   spread further suspicion on twitter about comet and the clinton pedophilia ring 
this would appear to be the new normal  not only disagreeing with your opponent but accusing her of running a pedophilia ring  provoking such fury that somebody takes it upon himself to start shooting  not only chafing when criticized in the press but stoking anti media hysteria that leads some supporters to threaten to kill journalists 
after the washington post reported sunday about the comet gunman and the nonsense conspiracy theory that motivated him  the reporters received emails and tweets saying    i hope the next shooter targets you lying sacks of s    in the media        god has a plan better than death     and    it would also be a shame if someone took a gun to    the post 
trump is not directly responsible for every violent word or action of his followers  but he foments violence  as the post   s executive editor  marty baron  has noted  when trump refers to journalists as    the lowest form of life        scum    and the enemy     it is no wonder that some members of our staff  at the post  and at other news organizations received vile insults and threats of personal harm so worrisome that extra security was required    
trump  during the campaign  fantasized about clinton and her judicial nominees being assassinated  he boasted that    i bring rage out    in people  and his violent rallies proved it  since the election  trump has falsely accused the media of inciting violence  at his speech in ohio last week he denounced the    dishonest    media no fewer than six times 
he has also been encouraging jones  leading publicist of the comet clinton pedophilia absurdity  trump has praised jones   s    amazing    reputation  called jones after winning the presidency to thank him for his support  and has regularly parroted jones   s conspiracy ideas 
now we are beginning to see the consequences of the rage and paranoia trump has encouraged  a disturbed man fires an assault weapon in a place where tots play ping pong  the only    crime    of the owner  james alefantis  was to be a clinton supporter who had  the wikileaks hack exposed  discussed with clinton aide john podesta the possibility of hosting a clinton fundraiser 
if trump were a different leader  he would declare that political violence is unacceptable in a free society  perhaps he   d say it after eating a    steel wills    pie at comet 
but instead he continues to fuel rage against his opponents and his critics  more and worse violence will inevitably follow
