it took me a while to get over the results of the us elections this year  i was watching the results with my friends at a downtown bar and the way it all ended left me angry  helpless  frustrated and completely drained of energy and hope  yes  i know i   m not american  but what happens in america affects all of us  even if we live half way across the world  i had invested every last ounce of my hope and positive energy into hillary clinton 
but when it became clear that she wasn   t going to be the next potus  i went into a downward spiral that honestly i haven   t quite come out of  given the overdose of pain and negativity that is anyway commonplace in my life  you see  as a listener healer to survivors of sexual abuse i have to deal with copious amounts of grief and pain every single day as every time someone narrates their experience  i relive mine  add that to the catastrophe that took place on   november  it becomes harder to bounce back  now  don   t get me wrong  i   m not trivialising sexual abuse by comparing the resulting grief with that which is born out of a political debacle  i   m merely saying pain gets compounded when it comes all at once even if it is from vastly different sources  this pain affects me  and slipped over the precipice into an endless vortex of hopelessness and despair  i receded further into my shell  sometimes  i just did not feel like getting out of bed  i would hug my dog and cry 
it is common to find distraction  avoid the grief or go into complete denial in such a situation  i have been through all those stages  but gradually i have been working towards finding sources of hope to re energise me  you see  sometimes  it is not just about your will to live  it has to do more with your purpose or raison d   tre  and oddly enough i found hope in the words of my fallen warrior queen  hillary clinton  when she said     this election has never been about one person     that was my cue 
i realised we need to look for new heroes and champions  the old guard may have fought the good fight  but now they need to pass on the baton  new hope can come from anywhere in the world  so who should i invest my trust in now  which man  woman or transperson has the potential to supercharge me and millions of people across the world  who can inspire us to continue to strive to make this world a better  nicer  politer  more united and compassionate place 
now  my political leaning is slightly left of center but even i   m a little scared of swinging as far left as elizabeth warren  however  she does raise excellent questions about how america has treated its have nots  she also proposes  somewhat radical  remedies  i will not discount her prospects because at least she is thinking in terms of finding solutions instead of just stating and restating problems 
well there   s also michelle obama  while she is decidedly apolitical  her measured words are a soothing salve to our wounds  i doubt she will ever run for president  but there is so much more she can do in many other leadership roles  i hope she continues to inspire people and stay active in public service in some way or the other 
then there   s amal clooney  she has a proven track record of using her legal prowess and intellectual acumen to address humanitarian crises across the world  should she consider a career in politics  she will make for an astute stateswoman and a compassionate leader 
i   m also willing to place a bet on condoleezza rice  she has a stellar academic background  an impressive if not somewhat intimidating knowledge of international geo politics and tonnes of experience in running the world  yes  she is republican  but so what  maybe she is their shot at redemption for hurling an orange duck in our faces 
nikky haley has also emerged as a political force in her own right  i   d keep my eyes peeled for that one  it would be interesting to see an american punjabi dealing with the un  she has some real steel in her 
i know i have only given examples of women leaders  but somehow i can   t quite picture men doing anything other than treating politics like an exclusive all boys club and brokering secret deals over expensive cigars in their drawing rooms over the weekend  i know that sounds sexist  but isn   t that what has been happening so far 
and don   t talk to me about bernie sanders  i lost respect for him when he asked hillary to    stop shouting    with a dismissive flick of the wrist  besides  his generic platitudes about people rising together sound a bit like anarchist bulls  t that teenagers spout when they want to sound all adult like 
but it isn   t just america that needs saving  europe is at the edge of darkness with extreme right wing parties represented by xenophobes vying for power  could this be the beginning of the end for angela merkel  i hope not  west asia and north africa also need strong and compassionate leaders to inspire and unite people if we are to ever eradicate the scourge of isis  up north in russia  apparently putin likes trump  that isn   t surprising  but terrifying in so many different ways  china has always been on its own trip and i have never quite understood the far east 
that brings me to india  can we look for inspiring young men  women and transpersons who can give us the government we deserve  can we find among us those who will strive for equality  inclusivity and basic human rights     all this with a modicum of decency  these may not be political leaders  just people dedicated to finding creative and lasting solutions  people who can help us recharge the batteries of our soul  so we can start helping others and healing ourselves in the process  we need new leaders
