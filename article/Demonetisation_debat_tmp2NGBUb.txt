the uproar continued amid sloganeering  despite finance minister sudhir mungantiwar rsquo s assurance that the chief minister and he would visit delhi and request the government to allow cooperative banks to accept old notes opposition leaders said farmers in the state were facing problems as they were not getting proper prices for their produce  
similarly  bank transactions at cooperative banks were affected in the wake of the rbi directive that prevented them from accepting high value notes  vikhe patil also pointed out how several people in the state had died in queues outside banks and atms ajit pawar of the ncp said the situation was aggravated by banks and atms that were unable to provide cash to people

as the speaker took up the second agenda  mdash  the condolence resolution  mdash  the opposition staged a walkout 
the issue also figured in the upper house  where opposition leader dhananjay munde  narayan rane of the congress  jayant patil of the pwp and others demanded to take the issue through an adjournment motion  which was rejected by council chairman ramraje naik nimbalkar 
rane said that several people had died outside banks and atms in a desperate bid to withdraw and deposit money  the figure had touched       ldquo demonetisation and the subsequent mismanagement shows the bjp led government rsquo s immaturity  rdquo  rane alleged as uproar continued  the chairman had to adjourn proceedings for    minutes 
when the house reassembled  proceedings were disrupted again with the opposition by storming out  
they insisted on a discussion on the issue through the motion  mungantiwar said chief minister devendra fadnavis had talked to union finance minister arun jaitley twice on the issue of cooperative banks  which refused to accept old notes 
he said the opposition was not able to gauge the mood of the nation which was in favour of demonetisation  he also admitted there were technical problems in a few banking set ups but said normalcy was returning to the system
