bethlehem star may not be a star after all
http://phys.org/news/2016-12-bethlehem-star.html
 astronomers  historians and theologians have pondered the question of the  christmas star  for many years   said mathews   where and when did it appear  what did it look like  of the billions of stars out there  which among them shone bright on that day so long ago  modern astrophysics is how we attempt to explain one of history s greatest astronomical events  
spoiler alert  it may not have been a star at all 
studying historical  astronomical and biblical records  mathews believes the event that led the magi   zoroastrian priests of ancient babylon and mesopotamia   was an extremely rare planetary alignment occurring in   b c   and the likes of which may never be seen again 
during this alignment  the sun  jupiter  the moon and saturn were all in aries  while venus was next door in pisces  and mercury and mars were on the other side in taurus  at the time  aries was also the location of the vernal equinox 
the presence of jupiter and the moon signified the birth of a ruler with a special destiny  saturn was a symbol of the giving of life  as was the presence of aries in the vernal equinox     also marking the start of spring  that the alignment occurred in aries  mathews said  signified a newborn ruler in judea 
 the magi would have seen this in the east and recognized that it symbolized a regal birth in judea   ultimately leading them in search of the newborn ruler  mathews said  based on his calculations  it will be        years before a similar alignment is seen again   and even then  the vernal equinox would not be in aries  running calculations forward  mathews couldn t find an alignment like the one known as the bethlehem star going out as far as         years 
 i feel a kindred connection to these ancient magi   said mathews   who earnestly scanned the heavens for insight into the truth about the nature and evolution of the universe  just as we do today
