tamil nadu   s   th chief minister  she was also the   th    th    th and   th  j jayalalithaa  who died on   december        was known for gifting her    million people a record set of freebies  but she also leaves behind a state that ranks among india   s top five in many social  crime and industrial indicators 
tamil nadu now has india   s lowest fertility rate      lower than australia  finland and belgium      second best infant mortality and maternal mortality rate  records among the lowest crime rates against women and children  and has more factories and provides more industrial employment than any other indian state  according to an india spend analysis of various data sets 
however  financing the freebie culture came at a cost  tamil nadu witnessed a    percent increase in debt   over five years ending       according to an india spend analysis of state budgets in november      

tamil nadu   s education indicators have always been above the indian average and have steadily improved during jayalalithaa   s from    years stint as chief minister 

although tamil nadu regularly reports violence and discrimination based on caste  the state   s crime rates are among india   s lowest  particularly those relating to women and children 

as regard industrial growth  tamil nadu has more factories than any other indian state           according to the annual survey of industries           maharashtra ranks second with        factories  followed by gujarat with         more people are engaged in industrial work       million  in tamil nadu of any indian state  maharashtra      million  is second and gujarat       million  third 

tamil nadu   s per capita income is india   s fifth highest  but the four states preceding it are substantially smaller  among the country   s large states  it has the richest people 

freebies come at a cost
jayalalithaa is known for the freebie culture  which she did not begin but did expand  personalising it along the way  for instance  her      election promises included     units of free electricity to every household  a free laptop for class    and class    students  with free internet connections   a gram of sovereign gold as marriage assistance  and four goats sheep to families who lived below the poverty line  the laptops had images of    amma  mother      as jayalalithaa was popularly known  other programmes also carried that name  such as amma canteens  for subsidised food  and amma medicals  for subsidised medicines  
while some programmes were applauded as having a social effect     such as the midday meal scheme  which tamil nadu pioneered before jayalalithaa took office for the first time in      and encouraged children to stay in school     they resulted in the fastest rising debt of any indian state  as indiaspend reported in november      

debt  per se  is not bad  if the state   s economic growth can sustain and service it  so  the key matrix is the debt as a percentage of the state   s gross domestic product  gsdp  or total economic output  tamil nadu   s debt to gsdp ratio at    percent is lower than the national average  an indication the state is growing despite the spike in debt
