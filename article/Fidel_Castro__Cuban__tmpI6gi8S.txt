 this is a man who set up a dictatorship that had no tolerance for anyone who thought differently 
as cuba embarks on nine days of national mourning for fidel castro  dissidents and exiles around the world labelled the revolutionary a dictator whose    crimes against his own people    must not be forgotten 
   history will absolve me     he once told judges of the regime he would eventually overthrow  transforming cuba into a communist state and incurring the wrath of the us and its punishing trade embargo 
for many he was a champion of the poor  a symbol of liberation who overthrew a dictator and brought free education and health care to the masses   
but to exiles who fled his autocratic rule  he personified a repressive regime that locked up political opponents  suppressed freedom and democracy and destroyed the national economy 
orlando    guti  rrez  founder of the opposition cuban democratic directorate in miami  condemned castro and his legacy as exiles and their descendants took to the streets of little havana to celebrate his death 
   i regret that this criminal never faced a tribunal for all the crimes he committed against his own people     mr guti  rrez said  according to a translation by the bbc 
   this is a man who leaves a legacy of intolerance  of setting up a family run dictatorship  which had no tolerance for anyone who thought differently  who set up a vicious totalitarian regime where people were persecuted for the most slight deviation from official ideology    
in the wake of his overthrow of cuban president fulgencio batista in       supporters of the old government were sent before summary courts and at least     were shot by firing squads over two years   
estimates of executions under castro   s    year rule run into the thousands  with monitors warning of unfair trials  arbitrary imprisonment and extrajudicial executions 
castro responded by insisting that    revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts  but on moral conviction    
as the one party system came into force  independent newspapers were closed and homosexuals  priests and others viewed as a threat were herded into labour camps for    re education      
censorship and repression spread  with fans of american rock    n    roll among those targeted  freedom of expression  religion  association  assembly  movement and the press were denied 
attempts made on castro s life since he came to power in            according to fabian escalante  former cuban security chief 
castro is a baseball fan   with    teams making up the cuban national baseball league
size of the original rebel army led by castro and including che guevara that sailed to cuba in       eventually toppling president batista on   january         
acts of  civil disobedience  logged in cuba in       according to a report by the exiled cuban democratic directorate       
total number of cubans believed to have emigrated while castro was in power  about     million     per cent of whom have settled in north america 
duration of a speech castro made at the un in         hours    minutes  listed by the guinness book of records as the longest speech made in the united nations 
films  castro is listed as an  uncredited extra  in the      musical holiday in mexico and as a  poolside spectator  in the romantic comedy easy to wed  also      
in       castro acknowledged holding        political prisoners  hundreds of thousands of cubans fled  including castro   s daughter alina fernandez revuelta and his younger sister juana    an unknown number of cubans drowned attempting to reach florida in flimsy boats 
when castro handed the presidency to his brother raul in       human rights watch  hrw  warned that the    abusive legal and institutional mechanisms    set up during the communist revolution continued to deprive cubans of their basic rights   
   even if castro no longer calls the shots  the repressive machinery he constructed over almost half a century remains fully intact     said the group   s americas director  jos   miguel vivanco     until that changes  it   s unlikely there will be any real progress on human rights in cuba    
hrw cited secret police  surveillance  short term detentions  house arrests  travel restrictions  criminal prosecutions and politically motivated sackings as methods of    enforcing political conformity     as well as restrictions embedded in legal and constitutional structures 
all media is heavily censored and the spreading of    unauthorised news    a criminal offence  with internet access heavily limited by cost and restrictions 
hrw also warned that the    counterproductive    us embargo   which president  barack obama   in his final state of the union address to condemn   gave the cuban government a pretext for violations 
instead of achieving the aim of toppling castro   s regime  monitors said the policy helped consolidate his hold on power    by providing his government with an excuse for its problems and a justification for its abuses    and enabling him to garner sympathy abroad     as did numerous and bizarre assassination attempts   
perhaps the country   s most prominent ally was russia  where past and present leaders were paying tribute to castro on saturday 
people celebrate after the announcement of the death of cuban revolutionary leader fidel castro  in the little havana district of miami  florida  us      november         reuters 
in a message of condolence sent to  the current cuban president  his brother raul   vladimir putin praised castro   s    free and independent cuba    as an    inspirational example    around the world 
   he embodied the high ideals of a politician  citizen and patriot  truly convinced of the cause to which he devoted his entire life     said the russian president 
the chinese president  xi jinping issued a national address saying     comrade castro will live forever    
statements from other world leaders were more measured  with france   s president francois hollande acknowledging human rights violations and    disillusionment    following castro   s revolution 
among his british defenders was ken livingstone  who described the former leader as an    absolute giant of the   th century    and blamed the us for the restrictions on civil liberties 
the former mayor of london said     i   m sure they will  over time  move towards something like a traditional west european democracy  it could have happened a lot earlier if you hadn   t had  the entire time  a blockade by america  attempts to overthrow the regime  eight assassination attempts authorised by american presidents    
mr livingstone told bbc radio     s today programme that    of course fidel did things that were wrong     adding     initially he wasn   t very good on lesbian and gay rights  but the key thing  that mattered was that people had a good education  good healthcare and wealth was evenly distributed    
there was no such praise among hundreds of cuban exiles and their descendants who poured into the streets of little havana in miami to celebrate castro   s death   
   cuba si  castro no     they chanted  while others screamed    cuba libre     as cars blew their horns and people danced 
   we re all celebrating  this is like a carnival     said    year old jay fernandez  who fled to the us aged    in       he held a sign reading     satan  fidel is now yours  give him what he deserves  don   t let him rest in peace
