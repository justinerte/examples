the side was heading to play the first leg of the final against colombian club atletico nacional in the city of medellin 
nacional responded to the crash by calling for chapecoense to be granted the copa sudamericana  the second highest club football title in south america 
the confederation said it had heeded nacional rsquo s request in deciding to hand the title to chapecoense 
it awarded nacional its conmebol centenary fair play award 
 ldquo there is no greater demonstration of the spirit of understanding and fair play    than the consideration and respect shown by atletico nacional to its brothers in chapecoense football club  rdquo  the statement said 
the small brazilian city of chapeco held a massive funeral on saturday for its team after the victims rsquo  coffins arrived home  each draped in the club rsquo s green and white flag 
a minute rsquo s silence for the team was scheduled to be held before every champions league and europa league game this week
