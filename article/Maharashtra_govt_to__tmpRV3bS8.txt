while the opposition plans to step up its attack on the bjp led government in the state assembly over demonetisation and its negative effects  the ruling party plans to counter it by raising the issue of reservation to the maratha community 
the congress and the nationalist congress party  ncp  have been trying to corner the bjp government over the issue of demonetisation  the issue dominated both houses of legislature as the winter session began on monday  on the opposition rsquo s agenda  highlighting the effects demonetisation is having on the common man as well as the rural economy  it has now decided to insist on an adjournment motion under which the day rsquo s agenda is suspended and discussions are held on an issue of public importance 
the ruling bjp  however  does not want to be cornered by the opposition on the notes ban issue  several party leaders are wary of the impact it has had on the rural economy  mdash  elections to zilla parishads  district council  will be held in the next two months 
as such  it is planning to bring a proposal in the assembly to discuss the issue of maratha reservation  this could put the opposition in a quandary  mdash  whether to continue with the protests over demonetisation or participate in the maratha reservation debate  traditionally  the maratha community forms a strong support base for the opposition congress and ncp parties   ldquo they  opposition  will have to decide whether to disrupt proceedings of the assembly over demonetisation or participate in the debate  if they resort to disruption  we can tell the community how the opposition parties are not serious about the issue of reservation  rsquo  said a source 
mumbai bjp president and bandra legislator ashish shelar on monday submitted a notice for the debate on the issue of maratha reservation on tuesday  
the move would also be timely for the government as maratha outfits are planning to resume the agitation with a protest march on december    in nagpur  where the winter session is underway 
 ldquo the outcome of the recent civic polls showed mobilisation of the maratha community has not worked against us  we are now considering ways to further win the support of the community  rsquo  said a key bjp functionary
