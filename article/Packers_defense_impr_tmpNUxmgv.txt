green bay  wis   ap     with so much potentially at stake for the green bay packers in the final month of the season  clay matthews is testing his tolerance for pain 
 quot  i m  a little sore  quot  matthews said monday  as he made a brief appearance in the locker room 
another encouraging performance by green bay s defense in a       win over the houston texans on sunday at snowy lambeau field included some gritty efforts by a few guys who played hurt 
while matthews is playing through a painful shoulder injury  fellow linebackers nick perry and jake ryan returned to the game after early setbacks sent them to the training room 
perry played the second half with a big club on his left hand after he left the field following the first series  ryan resumed playing late in the first half after he reinjured his ankle and limped back to the locker room to have it re taped 
 quot i respect those guys so much for that because that s a lot of physical toughness to do that  quot  safety morgan burnett said 
 quot it s also a lot of mental toughness to actually go in knowing that you re going to feel that pain  but when they say all hands on deck  those guys are an example of that  quot 
despite the adversity  the defense has solidified during a two game winning streak  which has green bay back to      with a     record and on a quest to catch the nfc north leading detroit lions       
the packers have allowed only    points each of the past two games after they gave up a whopping     points during the preceding four game losing streak 
 quot with where we re at  every game is a must win  quot  matthews said 
and after missing time earlier in the season with a hamstring injury  matthews doesn t feel compelled to sit anymore  no matter that his separated left shoulder left him to play with what he said was just one arm sunday 
 quot it s tough  but you just try to weather the storm  quot  matthews said   quot obviously  you want to be out there for your brothers and teammates  have some sense of accountability  quot 
though matthews had limited playing time and was noticeably absent from the stats sheet  his ability to play less than a week after he suffered the injury gave the defense a boost 
the packers were without rookie blake martinez  knee  for a second straight game  so they moved matthews inside to start alongside ryan  who had missed most of the previous three games 
matthews had been playing mostly at his natural spot of outside linebacker this season until martinez was hurt 
 quot we re lucky to have a guy like clay who  when someone s down  he can get back to the middle and do his job  quot  ryan said 
as the packers look to get healthier with their defense  matthews expects to be switching between outside and inside linebacker going down the stretch 
 quot i m fine with that  quot  said matthews  who started exclusively inside last season   quot we do a good job playing to my strengths as far as bringing some pressure  allowing me to get some one on one matchups and be a little more decisive as opposed to just sitting there and reading like a true inside  backer 
 quot there obviously comes a time for that  but it is easy when we have a lead  playing inside linebacker is a lot more fun  quot 
and the packers know the importance of having matthews on the field as they get ready to host the nfc west leading seattle seahawks on sunday 
 quot hopefully  he can get some strength  in the shoulder  and work through it  and hopefully he s further ahead than where he was yesterday because  obviously  he was playing through a very tough situation  quot  coach mike mccarthy said 
notes  mccarthy didn t have an update monday on the health of quarterback aaron rodgers  who played the game sunday in the snowy conditions after he injured his hamstring in green bay s previous game   quot i know after the game he felt pretty good  quot  mccarthy said
