prime minister nawaz sharif has become the first politician in pakistan rsquo s history to appoint six army chiefs  one of them  ndash  pervez musharraf  ndash  went against him and toppled sharif in a bloodless coup in       while the rest too gave him a tough time 
after assuming office in       sharif appointed gen asif janjua to succeed gen mirza aslam baig  unlike baig  who was ambitious and insecure  janjua was a very popular officer who commanded loyalty  but janjua  who earned admiration for tackling the mqm as corps commander in karachi  died of a heart attack in       leaving a leadership void  
this void was filled by gen abdul waheed kakar  a pashtun officer appointed by sharif who was seen as a weak candidate  it was kakar who brokered the agreement in mid      whereby sharif and president ghulam ishaq khan resigned after a constitutional deadlock  
sharif returned as premier in       when gen jahangir karamat was army chief  they got off to a bad start as the army was given a constitutional role in decision making through the national security council  sharif rejected the idea and the situation deteriorated to the point that karamat resigned in       
against all advice  sharif appointed musharraf in       soon after the kargil conflict  sharif moved to dismiss musharraf and appoint a new army chief  gen ziauddin butt  but the army rejected this and musharraf toppled the government 
sharif returned as premier in       when gen ashfaq kayani was the chief  soon after  sharif nominated gen raheel sharif  who was seen as close to the sharif family  but his three years as chief proved a testing time for the pml n government  
if the new chief  gen qamar bajwa  takes a strong stand on corruption  there could be friction between him and the premier  who faces the opposition rsquo s ire over allegations of graft in the panama papers leaks
