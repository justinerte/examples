bill cosby on monday lost one of the biggest legal battles leading up to his looming sex assault trial when a montgomery county judge ruled that prosecutors can tell jurors about damaging  decade old testimony in which cosby acknowledged offering drugs to women he wanted to seduce 
the decision means the once sealed      deposition that led district attorney kevin r  steele s office last year to reopen the investigation and charge the entertainer can become a pillar of the evidence offered to try to convict him 
cosby s lawyers argued that he agreed to the deposition   taken to resolve a lawsuit by his accuser  andrea constand   only because he had been promised by a previous district attorney that he would never be charged in connection with her claims 
but judge steven t  o neill concluded that no such agreement existed 
 quot there was neither an agreement nor a promise not to prosecute  quot  he wrote   quot only an exercise of prosecutorial discretion  quot 
o neill s six page ruling marked a significant victory for prosecutors and the latest setback for the    year old comedian actor as he inches toward a trial the judge has said he wants to begin by june 
cosby s lawyers declined to comment on the latest ruling  steele praised it 
 quot allowing the jury to hear mr  cosby s deposition testimony is another step forward in this case and will aid the jury in making its determination  quot  he said in a statement   quot it s important that we are able to present all of the evidence available  quot 
since he was charged last year with three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault  cosby has lost on every issue he has raised with the court  including a bid to have the case thrown out based on the same purported      oral agreement with then district attorney bruce l  castor jr 
testifying at a hearing in norristown this year  castor contended that he promised not to prosecute after concluding that constand s allegations that cosby drugged and assaulted her in      at his cheltenham home were too weak to take to trial 
in doing so  castor said  he hoped to force cosby to testify in the civil suit she had filed by removing any reason for him to assert his fifth amendment right against self incrimination 
but o neill  in his opinion  put castor s credibility under a microscope and found it lacking  noting that the former district attorney contradicted himself several times in statements to colleagues and reporters about the alleged agreement 
 quot there are numerous inconsistencies in the testimony and writings of mr  castor  quot  the judge wrote 
o neill also suggested that cosby might have had other motives to answer questions from constand s lawyers  including the fact that jurors deliberating in civil cases are allowed to consider whether a defendant agrees to testify or invoke the fifth amendment 
but constand s civil suit never reached that point  both parties settled out of court for an undisclosed sum a decade ago  as part of that settlement  transcripts of their testimony remained private under a confidentiality agreement   until a federal judge in philadelphia unsealed portions of cosby s deposition last year 
steele has cited the availability of that transcript   and cosby s own description of his sexual past   as a reason his office decided to reopen the criminal investigation that castor abandoned 
in the deposition  cosby testified that he had consensual sexual encounters with constand and other women  he also said he obtained seven prescriptions for quaaludes in the     s to use in encounters with women he hoped to seduce 
but he denied ever sexually assaulting anyone 
he also described a phone call with constand s mother a year after the alleged assault  in which he apologized but refused to say what pills he had given her daughter 
 quot i m not going to argue with somebody s mother who is accusing me of something  quot  he testified  according to the transcripts   quot and i m apologizing because i m thinking this is a dirty old man with a young girl  i apologized  quot 
at the time of the alleged assault  cosby was     constand  then the operations director for temple university s women s basketball team  was    
many of the other women cosby discussed in the deposition have since said he drugged and abused them 
several are at the core of the next big evidentiary fight in cosby s case   one set to play out in hearings next week in norristown 
steele hopes to call as trial witnesses    other women   among more than    nationwide who have made similar claims against cosby   to bolster constand s allegations 
cosby s lawyers are preparing a vigorous fight to keep those women off the stand  with plans to argue that their accounts are too old and too vague to be defensible 
they have also said that cosby is now too blind to recognize whether he had even met some of the women before
