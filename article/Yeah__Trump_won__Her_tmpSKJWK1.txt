for a nation that declared donald trump its president elect some    days ago  there sure is a heck of a lot of interest in counting the votes all over again  when green party candidate jill stein    after getting a whopping   percent of the national popular vote    asked voters to pay for recounts in the three states  pennsylvania  wisconsin  michigan  that so narrowly swung the election to trump  she raised millions of dollars in a matter of hours 
since then  stories on stein s quixotic efforts have frequently led the national broadcasts and the local news here in philadelphia  that s because the effort has tapped into both the disbelief of half of americans that trump actually won and their widespread fears of election hacking  especially by russia 
and yet there s a lot of reasons not to like the recount  reason no    is arguably stein herself  who    unlike hillary clinton  the candidate who would actually benefit if the recount gambit worked    has never been described as  likable enough   even though as a progressive guy i philosophically agree with many of stein s positions  i also find her to be like a saturday night live parody of a   st century rich  wine swilling liberal    tweeting about harambe  partying it up with putin in red square  and directing all her venom toward clinton  so mindless about the fundamental threat to democracy posed by trump  it s no wonder that so many critics question where the    million or so she raised for the recount will actually wind up 
yet there s a bigger problem with the recount than stein  despite all the understandable pre election fears about russian hacking  more on that in a minute   there s little about the actual november   results that leaps out as a sign that the hacking actually took place  yes  the polls in some states were way off  blame massive refusal rates and cell phones  not any conspiracy  and there like one wisconsin county where the initial numbers didn t add up  though there seems to be an explanation   but there s strong evidence that what appeared to happen on election day    blue collar types who haven t voted in years or flipped from obama to trump coming out for the gop upstart  plus lack of enthusiasm for clinton among urban non whites  which trumped a hillary surge in affluent suburbs    actually happened 
this is a painful thing for more than    million of us to admit  but here goes  donald trump won the electoral college 
 deep breath   having said that  this partial recount of the      results is a necessary and important thing  it absolutely needs to be done and done properly nbsp     as a down payment on future balloting that will make america s elections great again  in fact  i even hold my nose and applaud jill stein for pursuing this  here s why 
confidence in the american political process is completely shot  conservatives believe that millions of illegal votes were cast  either by undocumented immigrants or by dead people or through acorn  which hasn t existed since       but i digress      liberals believe the only way that trump could have won was through hacking straight out of the kremlin  the truth is out there  and in a time of heightened concern that trump s authoritarian tendencies have put the american experiment at risk  the truth about what really happened inside our voting booths is more essential than ever 
you can date this back to       the bush gore deadlock and the fiasco of the florida recount exposed flaws in the way that americans vote that got a lot of attention  the infamous butterfly ballot  and that didn t get enough attention  florida s life voting ban on felons  a policy that exists in some other states but in hardly any other civilized nations   to rectify some of that  congress passed an election reform bill and millions were spent on new electronic voting systems    which only created new problems  in       exit polls predicting that john kerry had won the electoral college were undone by the actual vote tally  spreading enough doubt that a challenge was lodged on the senate floor 
fast forward to       instead of addressing growing concerns that electronic results could be hacked and elections stolen  the  bleep  got real  in august  u s  government officials  albeit under the  regrettable  cloak of anonymity  charged that russian hackers had breached election data bases in illinois and in arizona  this came as the group wikileaks    again  some suspect  in concert with russian hackers    released a flood of emails  some politically damaging  from high ranking democratic officials in what appeared to be an effort by a foreign power to tilt the election toward trump  if russia was willing to use dirty tricks and hacking to aid trump during the campaign  then why not hack the actual results  that hopefully didn t happen  but just sowing these doubts has already accomplished a broader vladimir putin goal of disrupting faith in western democracy 
thus  a recount to the fullest extent possible in wisconsin  michigan and here in pennsylvania is the first baby step toward restoring faith in our democratic systems  by      or even the congressional elections of       much more should be done 
   to discourage hacking and other forms of election fraud  strategic audits and recounts should be a matter of course    just like the books at publicly traded companies or millions of individual tax returns are routinely audited    to ensure the integrity of the vote  what we have now is exactly the opposite  a patchwork of often arcane laws  administered by highly partisan judges  that tend to prevent recounts    and thwart accountability  that needs to change 
   to make these recounts and audits effective in the age of widespread hacking  every american should cast his or her vote on a paper ballot  too many of the electronic voting systems in place today leave zero paper trail  which makes them vulnerable to hacking efforts that would be nearly impossible to detect  the only guarantee of integrity in the   st century will be going back to the future of tamper proof paper 
   there s a third issue  and it may seem counter intuitive to some folks    but america needs to do so much more to make it easier for people to vote  in the      election  there s strong evidence that restrictive voter id laws in north carolina and wisconsin turned away tens of thousands of voters    and thus flipped the critical states to trump  indeed  despite the high stakes in this election  some     million eligible american voters stayed home  how much of that was apathy and how much is holding our election on a busy working tuesday  restrictive laws such as voter id  and precinct closings causing ridiculously long lines  with republicans ruling the roost in d c  and a majority of statehouses  this won t change any time soon  but think about it  the more fluctuation in how many people bother to vote  the easier for hackers to do their thing 
the kicker to all this is that even trump himself has claimed there was widespread election fraud in         tweeting out  falsely  without offering evidence  that millions of undocumented immigrants cast ballots  but now that a recount is potentially happening in just three of the    states  trump and his allies are working hard to block it  you have to wonder what the donald is so afraid of  as an allegedly successful businessman  the president elect should know that a thriving concern is one where all the numbers add up  it s way past time to balance the books in this now struggling enterprise known as american democracy
