washington  us president elect donald trump has accused china of currency manipulation and military expansionism in the south china sea  days after offending beijing by speaking over phone with taiwan president tsai ing wen 
the two tweets from trump sunday night is expected to add to the us china tension 
 did china ask us if it was ok to devalue their currency  making it hard for our companies to compete   heavily tax our products going into their country  the us doesn t tax them  or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea   trump said in a series of tweets

 i don t think so   the president elect said in his second tweet 
their country  the u s  doesn t tax them  or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea  i don t think so      donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december        

the president elect has already infuriated china by talking over phone with the taiwanese president the first by a top american leader since      
the washington post said trump   s protocol breaking telephone call with taiwan   s leader was an intentionally provocative move that establishes the incoming president as a break with the past 
china was a frequent target of trump   s during his presidential campaign and  as he prepares to take office next month  every sign points to his taking an aggressive line with beijing 
china regards self governing taiwan as a breakaway province  and the two sides enjoy a fragile peace marked by delicate political rhetoric and rising economic integration  china lodged a diplomatic protest with the us over the call 
us politicians often accuse china of artificially depressing its currency  the renminbi  in order to boost its exports 
interestingly enough  following trump s tweets the wall street journal reported that  yuan and the taiwan dollar slipped after trump tweets criticism of china
