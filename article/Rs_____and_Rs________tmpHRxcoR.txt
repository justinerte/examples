think of it as a    over one day cricket match  with each day equivalent to an over  the   game has just begun 
the government of india  popularly known as modi sarkar  has just created a    day hawala window for those with black money      albeit in a loose sense  the term hawala is usually used for illegal trade in foreign exchange going back to the times before       when india had tight controls on who could buy and sell foreign exchange  this created a black market in the us dollar and other  hard  currencies 
now  imagine a similar scenario in the old     and       rupee notes  which the government demonetised on wednesday  modi fans describe it as a  surgical strike     less than    hours after the announcement  it seems the scheme  like the strike  is controversial for its timing  manner and style 
soon after the announcement  an active government reporter tweeted   heard in the corridors of a sarkari office  two  sic  din ruk jaiye  hawala ke rates aa jaayenge    wait for two days  the black rates will come  
the prediction has almost come true  though the rates are not exactly known yet  this because the government has given official indications of what it intends to do  giving market players enough information and a chance to  discover  the market rate through what might begin with back of the envelope calculations and progress to a more dynamic mechanism  here s how 
revenue secretary hasmukh adhia said on wednesday that cash deposits of rs     lakh and above may attract tax and also a     percent penalty in case of income mismatch  any mismatch will be treated as tax evasion  he also added that small businessmen  housewives  artisans and workers had some cash lying at home should not be worried 
by saying that the government will get reports of deposits above rs     lakh and above  adhia only implied that those below that amount are likely to stay below the taxman s radar 
actually  adhia took the surprise out of the game  and set the ground for the discovery of hawala rates and the manner in which might happen through a distribution chain that might create itself over the    day window  just as batting partnerships happen through an innings in a one day cricket match 
picture this  an east delhi gym is reported to have announced that it is ready to accept demonetised rs     and rs       notes to attract new members  gold prices also shot up on wednesday      the yellow metal being the easily fungible global alternative to foreign exchange 
all you have to do now is to connect the dots  precisely the people who adhia mentioned     small businessmen and artisans in particular      may easily become the front men and women for a      day hawala game much in the way tourists and travellers were historically used by hawala traders in dubai  bangkok  hongkong and other centres  all they have to do is to take some risk and have reasons ready for the taxman  done within limits  that should not be an issue
gyms  salons  clubs and other enterprises may offer long term memberships against old cash and whitewash it with some smart legal payment mechanism  much like real estate dealers have in the past combined white plus black deals  there are also early reports out on how chartered accountants bring together rich firms with unexplained cash with others having a cash shortage 
jewellers and gold dealers may also perform much the same role as cas by using their enterprise to become intermediaries in exchange for higher gold prices  those with cash hoards will simply declare to banks only that much cash which will not raise eyebrows in the income tax department  they may    sell  the rest of their cash at market discovered money laundering rates    this is akin to the black market premium rates for foreign exchange  only  in this case  this would be a discounted rate for rupees  what the hoarder does is to incentivise the buyer for fronting the risk and add a premium for avoiding harassment at the hands of income tax officials 
watch out for gold dealers and small businesses active in the    day game  and expect some strokeplay as the slog overs arrive  india  after all  is the land of improvised innovation  or jugaad  with the reserve bank keeping a smaller window open for three more months  the game might get stretched a bit more
