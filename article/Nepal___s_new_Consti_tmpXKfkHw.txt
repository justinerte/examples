the other day kathmandu rsquo s radisson hotel  off a tiny lane crammed on either side by stores with nepalese and himalayan knick knacks  was crawling with security officials  the president and prime minister  their senior cabinet ministers and top officials  as well as diplomats  intellectuals  media and scholars  packed the sprawling conference hall  celebrating the   th anniversary of the end of nepal rsquo s brutal and divisive civil war 
but even as celebratory speeches rang out in the diplomatic and upper middle class neighbourhood of nepal rsquo s capital  the country was in the midst of a crippling constitutional standoff 
in fact  it is    years since that spring of       when a brief but powerful popular movement against the partyless panchayat system forced the late king birendra to introduce constitutional reforms  which led to the ushering in of democratic rule  many of the old guard from the nepali congress  nc   which led that fight under bp koirala and his brother girija babu or gp koirala as well as kp bhattarai and ganesh man singh  all of whom spent long years in prison  have gone 
gp koirala rsquo s nephew sushil  who helped negotiate the      midnight transition to power during those heady days of revolt and near revolution and found himself propelled into the pm ship  is no longer a leader of the nc 
the two comrades who led the breakaway maoist battle against the democratic but family led rule of the nepali congress and led the maoists to a stunning victory against the nc have fallen out  one is prime minister pushpa kamal dahal  better known as prachanda  who had held that post in           the other  baburam bhattarai  leads a breakaway faction in the opposition

as this manthan has taken place  the nepali economy  apart from its politics  has been grappling with two crippling shocks  the      earthquake and then the unofficial indian economic blockade  new delhi was taken by surprise by clauses in the constitution that it felt discriminated against the nepalis of indian origin  better known as the madhesis of the terai region  bordering nepal and india  the position was that the statute infringed upon citizenship processes  especially to those married to indians and their right to contest elected office 
after many months of negotiation and the ouster of prime minister kp oli  of the communist party of nepal  unified marxist leninist   widely seen as anti indian  the constitution process continues to struggle with the madhesi roadblock  showing how emotive such issues can become in a heterogeneous land  in an effort to break the logjam  prachanda proposed redrawing district borders to enable the madhesis and hill tribes to carve up a special area for themselves

this constitution amendment has run into opposition  both from a madhesi political alliance as well as furious blockades by the youth from schools and colleges opposing the effort  both sides say the same thing  it rsquo s unacceptable because it is discriminatory  mdash  but for different reasons 
the madhesi front says that it was not consulted on the proposed bill and the effort to push through the amendment did not address the core issue of citizenship  the nepalis opposing it in the affected province say that it would irreparably damage the resource and culturally rich region 
this quarter century has been a rocky ride on a rough road for the former himalayan kingdom and its elusive quest for a constitution that has the mandate and support of all political groups  while this has taken time  we should look at our own constitution making processes 
the effort to carve up a madhesi homeland is familiar to india  mdash  it takes a leaf out of the books of new delhi rsquo s experiences in the northeast and other parts of the country  the  lsquo remapping of india rsquo  is part of the political project of policymakers  weaving imagination  political flexibility and restructuring that have tested the boundaries of the constitutional process  this has grown over    years to meet local and regional aspirations  including most recently the division of andhra pradesh and telangana 
this addressing of regional aspirations as reinvented political entities has always been part of an effort by the state to curb  lsquo fissiparous rsquo  tendencies and tackle challenges to perceived national unity  it began with the fifth and sixth schedules of the constitution  passed after independence  which endowed special privileges and powers on tribal groups in central and eastern india 
the first reimagining exercise in the     s created states on the basis of language  this was extended to devise homelands as answers to insurgency in the northeast  mdash  nagaland in       the reorganisation of the north east  the first time the region had been so officially defined  with meghalaya and mizoram carved out of assam and statehood later to arunachal pradesh 
within states too  autonomy struggles have played out differently  ethnic demands for separate states have been met with special constitutional provisions for autonomous councils existing states like the bodoland territorial council in assam  negotiations to accommodate naga notions of sovereignty continue even after    years 
thus  the constitution making process in nepal is neither new nor slow  after all  the political accommodation described here has taken us more than a half century  and we rsquo re still at it  constitution making and nation building entail a flow of changes and experiments within a legal framework  this takes patience  sometimes the loss of lives  and there rsquo s give and take in the realm of public dialogue and pressure 
indian policy makers and commentators would do well to heed our own history in this process instead of pointing fingers at our neighbour
