official cuban census figures say black and mixed heritage people are about    percent of the island   s population  but a quick stroll around any cuban town will provide visual confirmation of just how many cubans of color deem themselves    white    when the government is asking  that may not be surprising  given that race is not an objective scientific category  but rather an organizing principle of political power     both before and after the revolution that brought fidel castro to power 
the black and mixed heritage share of cuba   s population is closer to a two thirds majority  according to other sources  including the u s  state department  which puts the figure at    percent   the university of miami   s institute for cuban and cuban american studies  also    percent  and cuban economist and political scientist esteban morales dom  nguez  who says it may be as high    percent   most of these assessments break down the population into roughly equal blocs of white  black and mixed 
even the dominant cuban terminology signals the issue   s knotty intricacy  the decidedly un pc term mulatto is used tenderly in conversation  defiantly on official documents  and derisively by the concerned neighbor who asks what color skin a robber had 
now  as the country enters a new era of fast and sweeping change  a long taboo political conversation about race is on the table as never before in art  music  film  and writing  in both official and dissident narratives  and in diverse circles across the socio economic strata 
this conversation is new  cuba pre fidel had been a place where multiracial alliances coexisted with persistent  entrenched racism and vast racial inequality  the last pre revolutionary president  fulgencio batista  was a mulatto who may have had some chinese and indian blood  while he may have firmly ruled that system of inequality  he was  demographically speaking  more inclusive than were the white revolutionaries who overthrew him 
from its start  fidel castro   s revolutionary movement was dominated by middle class white men  so white were its ranks  in fact  that during initial clashes with batista   s army  the government men were shocked 
   when captain ya  es came upon castro hiding asleep in a boh  o  it will be recalled that the soldier who found them cried     son blancos        they are white         it is not clear how many of the rebel army in the sierra were black but a majority certainly were not  and almeida  a mulatto  was the only officer of importance who was     wrote hugh thomas in his encyclopedic history tome    cuba  or  the pursuit of freedom    
but once the rebels won and tens of thousands of the wealthiest whites fled to florida  castro emphasized independence from american capitalism  improvements in healthcare  and literacy drives     and he also told american journalists in january      that his new government would work to erase racial discrimination once and for all  in       a north american survey found that    percent of black cubans were wholly in favor of the revolution  compared to    percent of whites 
the ensuing years saw visible gains towards social equality  the entire country was literate  regardless of color  and the     s  in particular  saw a generation of young black cubans whose parents had been sugarcane and service workers enter the workforce as doctors  engineers and professionals  still  despite major economic and social gains  black cubans     apart from general juan almeida bosque     remained unrepresented in the political leadership  in the years between castro   s ascendance and the      collapse of the soviet union  race was an issue kept under the rug 
   racism in cuba has been concealed and reinforced in part because it isn   t talked about     wrote roberto zurbano  editor of the government owned cuban casa de las am  ricas publishing house  in a      the new york times op ed     before          to question the extent of racial progress was tantamount to a counterrevolutionary act  this made it almost impossible to point out the obvious  racism is alive and well    
when soviet subsidies ended and the country stumbled into a deep economic crisis  racial inequality became more pronounced  remittances from cuban americans     who are    percent white  a bit more than    percent black or mixed race  according to u s  census information     mostly benefited white cubans  flicking on a tv to watch a cuban telenovela revealed whites in leading roles  staff in the country   s lucrative tourism industry were also white 
morales dom  nguez found that in          percent of scientists and technicians were white     percent of professors at the university of havana  too  these numbers held for the rest of the country  blacks were unemployed at double the rate of whites  blacks spearheaded more black market activities  jails held    percent darker skinned cubans 
in cuba   s particular version of stop and frisk  morales dom  nguez also found that blacks were stopped on streets at far higher rates than whites 
   the term that was used by the police force to refer to citizens who weren   t white was ciudadano con caracteristicas     citizen with characteristics     mixed race cuban writer alexis romay explained to al jazeera     if you were walking around with a group of friends  and the friends were a mixed variety of races     white guys  mixed race guys  and black guys     when the police stopped you  only citizens with characteristics would have to hand over their ids    
and despite official silence on the race issue  an overwhelming majority of cubans     three quarters  according to morales dom  nguez     agreed with the statement that    racial prejudice continues to be current on the island    
the very fact of morales dom  nguez   s book     put out by an official cuban publishing house  printed in cuba     pointed to an awakening  in the nascent era of raul castro  in the discussion of race  but the narrative remained stilted  after the publication of his times op ed  zurbano wasn   t fired  but he was demoted 
raul castro   s economic reforms between      and      have further exposed racial tension  cubans with tourist corridor homes or startup capital leverage resources to take full advantage of new laws that allow for restaurants  non professional businesses  the purchase and sale of private property  and more 
   the problem     said alejandro de la fuente  director of the institute of afro latin studies at harvard university     is that the new policies produce losers  because their chief concern is not social justice  but economic growth and survival  none of these policies is racially defined  but they produce new forms of social inequalities  and those inequalities tend to be racialized quickly because of unequal access    
recent months  and arguably years  have seen increasing public discourse around race  a two day forum in december  a ministry of culture sponsored rally  themed exhibits  a lot more  said de la fuente  has yet to happen to fully remedy cuba   s race issues  better  more accurate information  to start  along the lines of accurate census data and analysis  followed by policies that address the realities that information reveals 
but  he added     the great success of the afro cuban movement is that now  the starting point  of the official government perspective  is that there is indeed a problem
