in  an indication that the battle between the tatas and mistrys are escalating  both cyrus mistry and ratan tata camp made allegations and counter allegations days ahead of the extraordinary general meetings of six major tata firms  including tcs and tata motors 
in a representation to shareholders of the the companies  ousted tata sons chairman cyrus mistry on monday said the government has an  inherent obligation  to  remedy and repair breakdown  in the governance of tata trusts  the major shareholder of the group s promoter firm tata sons  alleging absence of appropriate structure and ethical behaviour of trustees  meanwhile  the tatas have countered the allegations made by mistry  according to a report in the times of india 
the tata group firms are to discuss a resolution seeking mistry s removal as director at the egms 
in the representation to the shareholders  he said the  governance of tata trusts has to become more accountable  transparent  and that the trusts enjoy many exemptions under law including exemptions from tax since they are solely for the benefit of the general public of india 
however  he said   in the absence of an appropriate governance structure and ethical behaviour of trustees  it would become an inherent obligation of the government to remedy and repair breakdown in the governance of such trusts  
seeking the government s intervention in his ongoing battle  mistry said government must ensure the working of the tata trusts have a defined  transparent governance structure 
 people who have been complicit or have enabled ethical and legal transgressions or have demonstrated a blatant disregard for good governance should not be allowed continue   he added 
the governance charter across the tata group  including the holding and operating companies requires repair to conform to company law and global best pratices such as protection of interests of all stakeholders  including minority shareholder  mistry said 
stating that the governance of tata trusts has to become more accountable and transparent  he said   at the heart of the sustainability of the tata group is governance reform  throughout the institution  
asking the shareholders of the companies to vote against the resolution to oust him and nusli wadia  mistry said   the tata group is no one s personal fiefdom  it does not belong to any individual  not to the trustees of tata trusts  not to the tata sons directors  and not to the directors of the operating companies  
it belongs to all the stakeholders  including each and every shareholders  he added 
mistry said that the very future of the tata group lies in how the trustees govern the tata trusts  since the main trust property is the holding of shares in tata sons 
 the conferment of all decision making power in one man or a  high command  among them is unethical  improper and a breach of trust   he said 
it is critical that serious decisions of severe magnitude and consequence are not taken whimsically  without much thought  or for unstated collateral objectives  mistry said in his representation 
 it is necessary to have a strong method of checks and balances in the trustees  decisions  particularly if decisions they take could indirectly give them personal benefits   mistry said 
tatas counter
according to the times of india report  tata sons has countered the allegations saying it was mistry who  concentrated all power and authority only in his own hands as chairman of the major tata companies  and that it was mistry who tried made the company into his  personal fiefdom  
according to the company  his chairmanship in other tata group companies was only a  corollary  to his position in tata sons   therefore  when he was removed as the chairman of tata sons  any other person would have stepped down from the chairmanship of tata operating companies because he no longer enjoyed the support of the principal shareholder   the toi report said citing a tata sons  statement 
the statement has also said that the tata trusts are governed by the individual wills of jamsetji tata  his two sons  sir dorabji tata and sir ratan tata and other founders and they trusts have been following the mandates in the wills 
 that is the reason the different trusts continue in existence for decades  even though disparate  the trusts do their best to integrate their efforts and to bring about the right results   the statement said  coutering mistry s allegations 
earlier  tata sons in a nine page letter had accused mistry of trying to take control of one of tata s units and creating distance between the promoter  tata sons  and its group companies  it also blamed him for nearly causing losses and eroding shareholder value 
subsequently  the mistrys had refuted the charges that he had any ulterior motive     to allege    ulterior motive    of taking over control of companies  demonstrated true independence is not there in keeping with tata governance standards    the tata sons statement reflects desperation     a statement from mistry s office had said
