a judge on monday ruled that testimony bill cosby gave in an accuser   s lawsuit can be used at his sexual assault trial in pennsylvania 
in his testimony  cosby describes giving drugs and alcohol to women before sex  making secret payments to ex lovers and hosting accuser andrea constand at his home in       cosby had become a friend and mentor after meeting constand at temple university  where he was a trustee and she managed the women   s basketball team 
the following exchanges between cosby and constand lawyer dolores troiani took place in      and       they are excerpted for brevity and to delete legal squabbling and repetition 
   
on constand 
q  when did you first develop a romantic interest in andrea 
a  probably the first time i saw her  at temple   s arena  
   
on the night in question 
q  can you tell me     what you recall of the night in which you gave the pills to andrea 
a  andrea came to the house  i called her      we talked about temple university  we talked about her position  and then i went upstairs and i got three pills  i brought them down  they are the equivalent of one and a half  the reason why i gave them and offered them to andrea  which she took after examining them  was because she was talking about stress 
   
cosby describes a several minute sexual encounter that followed 
q  so  you   re not telling us that you verbally asked her for permission 
a  i didn   t say it verbally  i said  the action is my hand on her midriff  which is skin  i   m not lifting any clothing up  this is  i don   t remember fully what it is  but it   s there and i can feel  i got her skin and it   s just above the hand and it   s just above where you can go under the pants 
q  then what happens 
a  i don   t hear her say anything  and i don   t feel her say anything  and so i continue and i go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection  i am not stopped 
   
troiani asks cosby about a phone call a year later between cosby and constand   s mother  gianni constand  who told him something was wrong with her daughter  who was also on the line 
q  what was the thing that you did not want to talk about 
a  i didn   t want to talk about     what did you give her    
q  why 
a  because we   re over the telephone and i   m not sending anything  the pill bottle  over the mail and i   m not giving away anything 
q  why didn   t you simply tell her     that you had given her daughter an over the counter drug called benadryl 
a  i   m not going to argue with somebody   s mother who is accusing me of something  and then when i apologize she says to me     that   s all i wanted to know  bill         and i   m apologizing because i   m thinking this is a dirty old man with a young girl  i apologized  i said to the mother it was digital penetration 
   
q  when she sat here and cried  constand  during her deposition   how did you feel 
a  i think andrea is a liar and i know she   s a liar because i was there 
   
on quaaludes 
cosby testified that he had gotten quaaludes from his doctor in los angeles in the     s  he said he was given seven prescriptions for the now banned sedative  ostensibly for a sore back

a  because i used them 
q  for what 
a  the same as a person would say     have a drink    
q  you gave them to other people 
a  yes 
q  did you believe at that time that it was illegal for you to dispense those drugs 
a  yes 
q  how did  the doctor  know that you didn   t plan to use  them  
a  what was happening at that time was that  that was  quaaludes happen to be the drug that kids  young people were using to party with and there were times when i wanted to have them just in case 
q  when you got the quaaludes  was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with
