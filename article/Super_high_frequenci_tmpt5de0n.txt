mobile operators want a way to keep urban users happy as they get more thirsty for data  and a professor in new york city thinks he s found what they re looking for 
in crowded cities  very high radio frequencies that most people had written off for use in cell networks might help carriers to stave off a feared bandwidth crunch for years  according to new york university s ted rappaport  that s why industry researchers are going to a conference in brooklyn this week to talk about millimeter wave wireless  an emerging technology that employs frequencies many times higher than those used today to carry cellular data 
equipment makers are also exploring the frequencies and think they could give an extra boost to the  g technology coming around      
rappaport isn t a typical professor  he s started and sold two cellular technology companies and has more than     issued or pending patents to his name  according to nyu  recently he and his students took to the streets of new york to test millimeter wave cellular networks and found that they worked better than expected  that s good news  because those higher bands have a lot of spectrum that s only lightly used and may someday relieve a shortage of available frequencies 
if the spectrum crunch that carriers fear becomes reality  it will probably hit first in big cities  where there are often thousands of people using cellular networks at the same time in the same area  the base stations that cellphones communicate with have limited capacity  and the more subscribers share it  the less data each one gets  eventually  while a simple email check might work fine  watching streaming hd video on a tablet could get iffy 
millimeter wave wireless could help delay that problem in at least a couple of ways 
one is to make it easier for a carrier to set up small cells for those densely populated areas  small cells are like the familiar large cells on towers but sit closer together and serve less territory  they can work alongside the regular cells and deliver more service over the same spectrum  because they re smaller and there are more of them  it s harder to connect these radios to a wired network  with millimeter waves  those links already can be made using point to point wireless beams  which gives carriers more options for where to set up small cells at a reasonable cost 
the other mission for millimeter wave radios will take a bit more r amp d  it involves using the additional frequencies in smartphones and small cells  shooting narrow beams of data around city streets even as mobile users walk and drive around  one way millimeter wave networks might make this work is by bouncing the beams off the sides of buildings and other objects  which are in plentiful supply in urban areas 
the cellular world has largely stayed away from these frequencies until now because it s hard to make them go a long way  especially when one end of the connection is a moving target like a smartphone  the waves won t go through buildings or cars  as most cellular signals can  focusing the radio s energy into a narrow beam can solve the distance problem  but typically that requires precise aim 
rappaport s tests in new york suggest millimeter wave networks could be made to reach farther than we previously believed  equipment vendors are excited about those findings  but there will be a lot of questions to address at the conference  researchers are looking at a variety of possible millimeter wave bands to use  ranging from   ghz to   ghz  more tests are needed to determine just how far millimeter wave signals can travel  using those high frequencies could also lead to shorter delays on the network  which would make voice calls and videos work better  but how much shorter isn t yet clear 
why make the effort  because millimeter waves offer a couple of advantages that current cellular frequencies can t touch 
first  they reduce interference because the beams are so narrow that there s little chance one will run into another  second  while there are few frequencies left to harness within today s cellular bands  there are huge amounts of largely untapped spectrum in the millimeter wave bands 
the cellular industry in the u s  and much of the world has so far limited its attention to frequencies below  ghz  nyu s rappaport said  looking far above that threshold into bands such as   ghz    ghz    ghz and   ghz reveals wider bands and fatter channels  with more spectrum for all 
 it s really virgin spectrum  very lightly used   rappaport said  there is an unlicensed portion of the   ghz band  where the wigig and wirelesshd technologies are used primarily for in room video connections and device docking  other users of millimeter wave bands include point to point wireless backhaul and microwave communications systems that are sometimes used where fiber is hard to install  such as across rivers  but some countries looking ahead to cellular scarcity  including china and south korea  are already starting to explore these bands for mobile use  rappaport said 
poor penetration and other issues make these high frequencies too hard to use without a clear line of sight  analyst craig mathias of farpoint research said  that s good for backhaul but not for the so called access networks that talk to phones 
 there are enormous trade offs here   mathias said   i personally don t see a very bright future for the access side of things   mobile networks have a lot of room to grow just by integrating wi fi  he said   we have plenty of spectrum down in the more reasonable end of the world where signals propagate a little bit better   mathias said 
but a new type of antenna  plus a growing amount of number crunching power  is getting a lot of people interested in millimeter waves  among the companies participating in the conference are ericsson  nokia solutions and networks  nsn   at amp t and intel 
most of the frequencies used in cellular have wavelengths a few inches long  just about the right size for the mobile phones we carry  rappaport said  it s possible to make antennas that are smaller than the wavelengths themselves  but that s hard and expensive  so most antennas in cellphones are a few inches long 
millimeter waves  by contrast  are no longer than a fingernail  that makes it possible to build a new kind of antenna  or rather collection of antennas  that can be precisely aimed and rapidly shifted  this so called phased array can point in different directions based on the charge applied to a given part of the array  such directional antennas  in both base stations and devices  allow them to keep sending signals to each other as a user travels  in addition  more than one signal can be steered toward the same mobile device  delivering even more data  rappaport said 
the nyu professor is on the right track  according to analyst phil marshall of tolaga research  who once worked with rappaport at the university of virginia 
 your antenna design is what s going to be the key   marshall said   how effective you can be in doing very rapid beam forming   phased array antenna technology has been available for years  but for mobile use it takes a powerful processor to keep reconfiguring the antennas so they stay aimed at each other  marshall said 
at the conference  vendors and researchers will compare notes to figure out just how much they can get out of millimeter waves  that s only the start 
 there are some results available but not nearly enough in different kinds of environments   said lauri oksanen  vice president of research and technology at nsn 
oksanen hopes millimeter wave networks will be able to reach phones at least     meters away  that s roughly how far apart carriers will place lte small cells  he said  if the higher frequencies provide the same range  then operators will be able to add the future technology at the same sites  nsn s results suggest millimeter wave cell signals can go tens of meters  at least  rappaport says his team got good results at     meters on the streets of new york 
it s also not clear how soon the new wavelengths will start bouncing around urban canyons  there s already a phased array antenna on the market for smartphones and tablets  made by silicon image for use with wirelesshd  wi fi networks with multiple antennas and beam forming  available for several years now  use similar technology  the development that s already gone into those systems should help to feed development of cellular systems in the high bands  rappaport said 
market forces and regulation will also play a role  carriers are already committed to rolling out lte networks for the next few years  so they ll probably wait until at least the next big technology jump to  g  probably around       rappaport said  governments will also have to change their rules for the high frequencies  probably a years long process 
nsn  which is developing millimeter wave backhaul technology with partners  says carriers are interested in that technology and the market for it will probably take off as soon as they start rolling out high volumes of small cells  but cells won t start talking to phones over the higher frequencies until later  nsn expects  g to come out for conventional cellular frequencies first and later for millimeter waves 
 for capacity and supporting different use cases  we don t need the millimeter wave solution yet by        oksanen said   that would be a few years later  
the cellular bands below  ghz won t suddenly get filled up one day  tolaga s marshall said  it will just get more expensive to squeeze the next bit of capacity out of them  until at some point it may be cheaper to use millimeter waves  if that happens  the nyu research could prove prescient  he said 
 never underestimate ted rappaport   marshall said   he s a pretty smart guy
