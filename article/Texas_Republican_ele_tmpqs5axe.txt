austin  texas          nbsp a republican member of the electoral college from texas said monday that he won t cast one of his state s    electoral votes for donald trump because  quot i am here to elect a president  not a king  quot  
dallas paramedic chris suprun previously indicated he would support trump  but he now says the president elect s postelection attacks on the first amendment and the country s electoral process  as well as the billionaire businessman s continued promotion of his brand and business interests overseas  changed his mind  
texas law doesn t mandate that electors vote according to the results of the state s presidential election  which trump won by nine percentage points over hillary clinton  suprun and the gop s other electors signed pledges at the state republican convention in dallas this summer promising to vote for their party s nominee  but those aren t legally binding  
 quot i m expecting backlash  but that has been par for the course this campaign  people are unhappy  they re angry  but i m angry  too  quot  said suprun  who said that prior to changing his mind he had received hundreds of emails  letters and phone calls urging him not to support trump  
suprun said the electoral college system  quot is fine as it currently exists  quot  his problem is just with its winner  
 quot i was told if we elected donald trump he would transform his personality into being presidential  he isn t  quot  suprun said   quot i wanted him to be presidential  but since the election he hasn t grown into our institution  he s attacked them  i am here to elect a president  not a king  quot  
another texas republican elector  art sisneros  resigned last week rather than vote for trump  electors will vote to replace sisneros when they convene dec     in austin and in state capitals across the country to vote for president  
suprun said he was not resigning but also won t be voting for hillary clinton  
 quot i am not sure of who i will vote for  but would have to strongly consider someone like  ohio gov  john  kasich who has both executive and legislative experience bringing people together  quot  he said  
suprun said he was waiting to see if other electors will revolt and rally behind a trump alternative like kasich  
 quot i m looking for someone we can all unify behind  quot  he said
