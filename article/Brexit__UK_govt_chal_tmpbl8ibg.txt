london  prime minister theresa may s government launches a challenge on monday against a court ruling that it requires parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the european union  a decision that could upset britain s brexit plans 
if the supreme court  the united kingdom s highest judicial body  dismisses the government appeal it could derail may s timetable for triggering article    of the lisbon treaty and leaving the eu 
the government s legal fight comes against a backdrop of claims by some politicians and newspapers that establishment judges want to thwart the brexit process 
it will be the most high profile and complex case the court has considered since it came into being seven years ago and is due to last for four days  for the first time all its    justices will sit on the panel with the verdict due later in january 
 the case raises difficult and delicate issues about the constitutional relationship between government and parliament   brenda hale  the supreme court s vice president said in a speech last month 
 what is meant by the exercise of the executive power of the state  we do not have a written constitution to tell us the answer  but i doubt whether many written constitutions would tell us the answer either  
if may wins  she can proceed with her plans to invoke article    by the end of march 
but if she loses  parliament could in theory block brexit as most lawmakers  mps  supported staying in the eu in a referendum in june  though few observers expect such an outcome  even so  lawmaker approval could open the process to greater scrutiny and delay 
investors believe the greater parliament s involvement the less chance there is of a  hard brexit  in which tight controls on immigration are prioritised over european single market access  the pound surged after november s high court ruling 
in a sign of how thorny the process could be for may  the pro eu liberal democrat party says it would vote against article    unless there is a new referendum on the final brexit deal  a concession may is highly unlikely to make 
the party won a ninth seat in parliament on thursday in a local by election vote 
the high court challenge was brought by investment fund manager gina miller with hairdresser deir tozetti dos santos the second claimant 
other parties will also be allowed to offer legal arguments this week  including the devolved welsh government  a group of ex patriate britons  and the independent workers union of great britain which represents mainly low paid migrant workers 
so too will the scottish government  which strongly opposes brexit and has been seeking ways to keep scotland in the eu 
the case hinges on whether the government can use a historical power known as  royal prerogative  to invoke article    without lawmakers  assent 
useful distraction 
the challengers argued that britons would inevitably lose rights granted under an act of parliament when leaving the eu  and that under britain s unwritten constitution such rights could only be taken away with parliamentary approval 
the high court agreed with this  rejecting the government s assertion parliament had given its approval by allowing a referendum and that it was established the executive alone could make or leave international treaties 
the government s prepared argument for the supreme court is little changed from before  miller has told reuters she suspected may might be happy to lose  with the court battle providing a useful distraction to ministerial divisions and brexit indecision 
june s vote to leave the eu exposed deep divisions in britain  and some pro brexit politicians condemned the high court for flouting democracy  the daily mail newspaper called the three senior judges involved  enemies of the people  
miller herself has become a target of hate and has received abuse and death threats 
some lawmakers in may s conservative party have also called for supreme court president david neuberger to stand down because his wife had posted anti brexit messages on twitter 
one of the court s justices  brian kerr  said judges would not be swayed by personal views 
 that s not to say we don t have personal views  but we are all extremely conscious of the need to set aside our personal views and apply the law as we conceive it to be   he told the bbc last month 
meanwhile  upsetting the media  politicians and some of the public is unlikely to faze neuberger and the other justices 
 parliament no doubt appreciates that the unelected judges sometimes are more easily able to do what is right  but temporarily unpopular  than politicians who need to submit themselves at least every five years to the electorate   neuberger said in a      speech
