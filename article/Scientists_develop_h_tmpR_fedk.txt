london  researchers have developed a new polymer patch that can be stuck onto the heart without the need for stitches to improve the conduction of electrical impulses across heart tissue damaged during a heart attack 
heart attacks create a scar  which slows and disrupts the conduction of electrical impulses across the heart 
 this leads to potentially fatal disturbances of the heart rhythm  our electrically conducting polymer patch is designed to address this serious problem   said sian harding  professor at imperial college london 
the new stitch less patch is stable and retains conductivity in physiological conditions for more than two weeks  compared with the usual one day of other designs 
 no stitches are required to attach it  so it is minimally invasive and less damaging to the heart  and it moves more closely with the heart s motion   said lead damia mawad at university of new south wales in sydney 
the patch is made to adhere to the heart tissue by shining a green laser on it 
the team tested the patch by implanting it into rats  they found it improved the conduction of electrical impulses across the heart scar tissue 
 we envisage heart attack patients eventually having patches attached as a bridge between the healthy and the scar tissue  to help prevent cardiac arrhythmia   mawad said 
 the patch can help us better understand how conductive materials interact with heart tissue and influence the electrical conduction in the heart  as well as better understand the physiological changes associated with heart attacks   explained molly stevens  professor at imperial college london 
the research was published in the journal science advances
