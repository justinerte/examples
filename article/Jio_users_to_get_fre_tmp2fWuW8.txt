taking jio rsquo s offer a step further  mukesh ambani  chairman and managing director of reliance industries limited  on thursday launched  lsquo jio happy new year rsquo  offer for its new and existing customers 
 ldquo starting dec         every new jio user will get data  voice  video and the full bouquet of applications absolutely free till march           we are calling this jio happy new year offer  all existing jio customers will get extended benefits of jio happy new year offer on current sims  rdquo  ambani said in an address to stakeholders at ril rsquo s navi mumbai office 
starting its service in september  jio has already bagged over    million customers  he said  adding   ldquo in the first three months  jio has grown faster than facebook  whatsapp or skype  rdquo 
ambani said that on an average a jio customer was  ldquo using    times more data than the average indian broadband user  rdquo 
he said under the jio happy new year offer   jio customers will get    times the average usage on other networks absolutely free till  march          
jio has signed up more than   lakh customers every single day in the last three months  with the help of fast track aadhaar based ekyc  which allowed sim activation in five minutes 
 ldquo today  jio has successfully rolled out ekyc across   lakh outlets in india  to put this in perspective  this is nearly equal to the total number of atms in india  we are in the process of doubling this network  to   lakh digitally enabled outlets  by march       rdquo  ambani said 
talking about the contentious issue of points of interconnections between jio and other telecom operators  ambani said  ldquo we have not received the required support from existing operators  rdquo 
 ldquo in the last three months  nearly     crore voice calls from jio customers to the networks of our three largest competitors were blocked  the benefits of jio rsquo s superior voice technology have been denied to indian customers due to such anti competitive behaviour of incumbent operators  rdquo  he added 
 ldquo while we have started getting points of interconnect  we continue to monitor this capacity so that the jio voice calling experience remains superior  over the past months  the call block rates has come down from over    per cent to nearly    per cent as of yesterday  rdquo  
 ldquo we are working with all our fellow operators to ensure that in the coming weeks  this will come below the specified grade of service  which is     per cent  i want to reiterate that jio is committed to ensuring that all domestic voice calls by jio customers will be flawless and free  rdquo  he added 
he thanked the government and the telecom regulator for enforcing the licence conditions 
saying that jio now fully supports mobile number portability  and all customers can retain their existing number when they migrate to jio  ambani added   ldquo we have recently introduced home delivery of jio sims  so that these customers  who are often too busy to visit a store  can get a jio sim home delivered  rdquo 
 ldquo and once delivered  the jio sim can be activated in   minutes through ekyc  this feature is being progressively launched across india through the myjio application and will be available in the top     cities by december           rdquo 
about   per cent of jio towers have experienced congestion due to abnormally high data usage  
 ldquo as a result  customers served by these towers have experienced lower data speeds  while    per cent of our base stations  and customers  have been experiencing consistently high data speeds  we are not satisfied  
 ldquo we are working to decongest these   per cent towers  so that impacted customers go back to experiencing true  g speeds  on the whole  jio is not only delivering   times more data than all other indian telecom operators combined  but also much faster throughputs than any other mobile network in india  rdquo  ambani said
