president elect donald trump chose ben carson  a former rival for the republican nomination  on monday to be secretary of the department of housing and urban development 
but there was still no word on his secretary of state  the nation rsquo s top diplomat who will be trump rsquo s emissary to the world   announcing carson rsquo s nomination monday  trump said   ldquo we have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival  very much including our inner cities  mostly poor areas dominated by african americans rdquo  
 ldquo ben shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a presidency representing all americans  rdquo  the president elect added
carson  a renowned neurosurgeon  has no experience in housing  and was once a shoo in for the post of secretary of health and human services  but he took himself off the table saying he had no plans of joining the trump administration 
trump has  so far  named his secretaries for treasury  commerce  health  education  defence  semi officially  and the attorney general  chief of staff and chief strategist  but everyone is waiting now for the big one  secretary of state 
speculation continues  with new figures joining the list every passing day  a trump transition team official confirmed on sunday the list had been expanded beyond the four favourites  mitt romney  the republican presidential nominee in       rudy giuliani  former new york city mayor  senator bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and former cia director david petraeus 
the expanded list actually has two very avid supporters of strong bilateral ties with india  mdash  former utah governor and      candidate for the republican presidential nomination jon huntsman and congressman dana rohrabacher 
rohrabacher  a member of the house of representatives from california  has himself claimed to be being considered for the position in a tweet  but trump transition team don rsquo t think he will go the distance  mdash   ldquo possibly deputy secretary of state rdquo   said one 
the congressman used to be a strong supporter of pakistan and  by definition therefore  a critic of india  but changed overtime  he told this reporter  because of islamabad rsquo s record on terrorism 
rohrabacher is now one of pakistan rsquo s bitterest critics on capitol hill and has called for declaring pakistan a terrorist state  which would deny islamabad and aid and military supplies  at the least  in a bill he introduced jointly in the house in september
