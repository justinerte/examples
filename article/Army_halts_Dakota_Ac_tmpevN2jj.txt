http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-dakota-access-deadline-20161204-story.html
the army corps of engineers on sunday denied permission for the dakota access pipeline to cross under a section of the missouri river  handing at least a temporary victory to the standing rock sioux tribe and its supporters 
the decision came after months of protests by thousands of self proclaimed        water protectors                bolstered by the arrival of more than       u s  military veterans nbsp         who have opposed the pipeline out of concern that it could rupture and contaminate the river  which they say provides drinking water to the tribe and    million other americans 
the pipeline is being built by energy transfer partners  whose chief executive  kelcy warren  has said the company would not be willing to explore alternative routes 
the pipeline was nearly completed  save for the nbsp proposed section that would have passed underneath lake oahe  a reservoir on the missouri river  the army corps of engineers nbsp denied a permit necessary for that section to be built

the corps said sunday it would explore alternative routes and could initiate a more thorough and lengthy environmental analysis of potential risks posed by the      billion        mile pipeline 
 quot although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the standing rock sioux and dakota access  it s clear that there s more work to do  quot  jo ellen darcy  the army s assistant secretary for civil works  said in a statement   quot the best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing        
in a related memo also released sunday  darcy expanded on the corps        nbsp explanation for denying the permit  she cited policy by the white house council on environmental quality  which has said in the past that concerns about tribal resources and environmental justice should  in some cases         heighten agency attention        to exploring alternative solutions for projects  she said the increased analysis she announced sunday for the dakota access pipeline reflected such heightened attention 
darcy also noted that some documents related to the planned pipeline  including studies examining the risk of an oil spill  had been withheld from the tribe in the past        because of security concerns and sensitivities         the tribe has said repeatedly  including in court  that it was not properly consulted on the pipeline and that the pipeline       s risk had nbsp not been fully examined  nbsp 
in recent months  thousands of people have set up camp on the edge of north dakota s cannonball river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation  vowing to place themselves in the way of the pipeline to block its construction  nbsp native americans from across the country have joined the cause  as have environmental groups and celebrities 
as the news broke sunday  the main seven council fires camp erupted in celebration  nbsp pipeline opponents joined hands in a giant human chain around the camp  victory and honor songs rang out as children  not entirely clear what the fuss was about  sledded down hillsides slick with a recent snow 
       pretty darn good         said kandi mossett of the indigenous environmental network  when asked for her reaction         this nbsp is really big news  my immediate reaction is  this is a victory  but we must remain vigilant        
pipeline opponents are pushing for a full environmental impact statement  a process mossett said would take three years and would effectively kill the project 
a range of environmental and indigenous rights groups celebrated the army corps of engineers  nbsp decision 
       today  the voices of indigenous people were heard  the rights of a sovereign nation were respected         rhea suh  president of the natural resources defense council  an environmental advocacy nonprofit  said in a statement   quot the standing rock sioux and the myriad of indigenous communities by their side remind us all of the power of individuals to stand up and stand together to demand environmental justice        
standing rock sioux tribal chairman david archambault  who broke the news to gleeful throngs at the main camp  cautioned vigilance  opponents worry that president elect donald trump  who recently reiterated his support for the pipeline project  could reverse the corps        decision 
 nbsp        a denial only gets us to jan             mossett said 
supporters of the pipeline attacked the decision 
       this purely political decision flies in the face of common sense and the rule of law         craig stevens  a spokesman for the main coalition  an industry group  said in a statement         unfortunately  it       s not surprising that the president would  again  use executive fiat in an attempt to enhance his legacy among the extreme left  nbsp that the president continues to believe that he is above the law is simply un american  and it is this arrogance that working class americans soundly rejected on nov     nbsp for millions of hard working people across the heartland  jan  nbsp    cannot come soon enough         nbsp  nbsp 
stevens added   quot with president elect trump set to take office in a    days  we are hopeful that this is not the final word on the dakota access pipeline        
jan hasselman  a lawyer for earthjustice who is representing the standing rock sioux in court  said sunday that the corps was        doing the right thing        by pursuing alternatives and more environmental analysis  he acknowledged that a trump administration could try to undo the corps        decision  but  he said         it       s not so simple as reversing it with the stroke of a pen  any reversal would be subject to close judicial scrutiny  and we are fully prepared to bring that case        
the news broke as thousands of veterans continued to stream in from across the country in charter buses and private vehicles  nbsp hundreds of them stood in a snowy field near cannon ball  where rep  tulsi gabbard  d hawaii  and tribal elders addressed them  nbsp many wore fatigues  others carried american flags 
       i honor you on behalf of my family  on behalf of the families and communities on standing rock         said tribal elder phyllis young         we hold all of the veterans in very high regard and we have many who suffer ptsd        
choking back tears  young said that her own daughter  a former army captain  committed suicide two years ago  nbsp        i know that it was conditions of war         she said  nbsp         but we have honored  nbsp we have been good americans  we have served courageously  nbsp we have done our duty         nbsp 
addressing the veterans  some of whom had tears streaming down their faces  young added  nbsp        we don       t want any of you to have nbsp flashbacks  nbsp and that is the purpose of our peaceful venture  nbsp so that you can take on our belief system of peace  nbsp we care about you  nbsp care about your health  nbsp your conditions  nbsp your well being  spiritually  emotionally  physically  nbsp i thank you for being here        
as she spoke  more buses and private cars were pulling up on the narrow paved road alongside the gathering  nbsp   nbsp 
       our numbers are vast         said dex mclelland      an former army infantryman who led a team of north carolina veterans in a black ford transit van  nbsp        we mobilized       people in four days        
mclelland  a disabled veteran who served in afghanistan  arrived wearing his dog tags and camouflage pants  nbsp 
       you can       t allow big money to come in and rip up the constitution in the faces of america       s oldest citizens         he said         these are the original americans  nbsp don       t you think they       ve caught enough slack  about makes you cry when you think about it        
by late afternoon  the thousands of native americans  environmental activists and veterans gathered in the seven council fires camp were nbsp taking the time to celebrate 
in a statement  archambault expressed        the utmost gratitude for the courage it took on the part of president obama  the army corps  the department of justice and department of the interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing         the standing rock tribe and all of indian country will be forever grateful to the obama administration for this historic decision
