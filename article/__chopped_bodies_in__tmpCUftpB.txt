three different teams of investigators are comparing notes to answer a question that rsquo s haunting delhi police  has a new serial killer emerged in the capital 
three mutilated bodies have been found in a    kilometre radius in south delhi over the last    days  the modus operandi seems similar  mdash  the bodies were mutilated  hacked and dumped in drains or street corners  in each case  police believe the murder was carried out far from the spot where the body was recovered  the bodies were either naked or dressed only in undergarments 
however  senior police officers are hesitant to attribute the murders to a single killer  mdash  or even suggest that they may be linked  mdash  because they don rsquo t have any evidence to support the theory  moreover  they have not been able to identify the victim or recover the murder weapon in any of the cases 
 ldquo it could be a mere coincidence that all the three bodies were hacked  our teams are working on solving this case soon  rdquo  joint commissioner of police  south west  dependra pathak told ht  
the first incident came to light on november     when the decapitated body of a woman  mdash  possibly in her mid   s  mdash  was recovered from a sewer on the ground floor of a munirka building  a week later  on the morning of november    a murdered man with his legs chopped off was found under a tree in mangal bazar area of sangam vihar 
in the third incident  the body of a woman with her lower torso missing was fished out of a drain near the delhi jal board office at amar colony on november    
 ldquo on sunday evening  police found a human torso in a sewer located    metres from the scene of the crime  as it was partially eaten by street dogs  they were unable to verify if it belonged to a man or a woman   ldquo we think the torso belongs to the victim  we will ask doctors to conduct dna and bone tests to confirm this  the body part was in a highly decomposed state  rdquo  an officer said

the head of the decapitated woman is yet to be recovered 
police believe all the three victims were from places outside delhi because they were unable to match them with missing reports filed in the city over the last one month
