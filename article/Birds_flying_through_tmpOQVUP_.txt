birds flying through laser light reveal faults in flight research
http://phys.org/news/2016-12-birds-laser-reveal-faults-flight.html
it s just another day at the office for a parrotlet named obi 
as a graduate student working with stanford mechanical engineer david lentink  eric gutierrez trained this member of the second smallest parrot species in order to precisely measure the vortices it creates during flight  their results  published in the dec    issue of bioinformatics and biomimetics  help explain the way animals generate enough lift to fly and could have implications for how flying robots and drones are designed 
 the goal of our study was to compare very commonly used models in the literature to figure out how much lift a bird  or other flying animal  generates based off its wake   said diana chin  a graduate student in the lentink lab and co author of the study   what we found was that all three models we tried out were very inaccurate because they make assumptions that aren t necessarily true  
scientists rely on these models  developed to interpret the airflow generated by flying animals  to understand how animals support their weight during flight  the results are commonly referenced for work on flying robots and drones inspired by the biology of these animals  bio inspired robots are a specialty of lentink   his students developed the first flapping robot that can take off and land vertically like an insect and a swift like robot with wings that deform as it swoops and glides 
birds wearing goggles
for this experiment  gutierrez  the study s lead author and former graduate student in the lentink lab  made parrotlet sized goggles using lenses from human laser safety goggles   d printed sockets and veterinary tape  the goggles also had reflective markers on the side so the researchers could track the bird s velocity  then he trained obi to wear the goggles and to fly from perch to perch 
once trained  the bird flew through a laser sheet that illuminated nontoxic  micron sized aerosol particles  as the bird flew through the seeded laser sheet  its wing motion disturbed the particles to generate a detailed record of the vortices created by the flight 
those particles swirling off obi s wingtips created the clearest picture to date of the wake left by a flying animal  past measurements had been taken a few wingbeats behind the animal  and predicted that the animal generated vortices remain relatively frozen over time  like airplane contrails before they dissipate  but the measurements in this work revealed that the bird s tip vortices break up in a sudden dramatic fashion 
 now  whereas vortex breakup happens far away behind the aircraft   like more than a thousand meters   in birds  it can happen very close to the bird  within two or three wingbeats  and it is much more violent   said lentink  who is the senior author on the paper 
taking on three theories
the question was whether models of lift based on an inaccurate idea of an animal s wake were valid 
the team applied each of the three prevailing models to the actual measurements they recorded and from that generated three different estimates of the amount of lift obi generated with each wingbeat  they then compared those calculated estimates of lift to the actual lift measured in a previous study carried out using a sensitive device developed by the lentink lab   the instrument  an aerodynamic force platform  is so sensitive that it nearly broke when they tested a prototype by popping a fully inflated balloon inside  said lentink  
what they found is that to varying degrees  all three models failed to predict the actual lift generated by a flapping parrotlet 
new models needed
this research highlights challenges in developing flying robots based on what s known about animal flight  the differences between the three models  plus the variety of animals involved in earlier studies  including other bird species  bats and insects  makes comparison within the literature extremely challenging  as shown by the problematic performance of the current options  a completely new model may be the answer 
 many people look at the results in the animal flight literature for understanding how robotic wings could be designed better   said lentink   now  we ve shown that the equations that people have used are not as reliable as the community hoped they were  we need new studies  new methods to really inform this design process much more reliably  
a new instrument may help to carry out tests to optimize miniature drones  in attempts to assess their flight performance more precisely  a team from stanford university have shown how flapping wings enable flying animals    
swans and geese are the envy of aeronautical engineers  even plump geese can perform remarkable aerial acrobatics     twisting their body and flapping their powerful wings while keeping their head completely still 
there is a long held belief among engineers and biologists that micro flying robots that fly like airplanes and helicopters consume much more energy than micro robots that fly like flies  a new study now shows that a fly    
up to now  the speed record for horizontal flight was held by birds from the swift family  the common swift  for example  can reach speeds of over     kilometres per hour  together with colleagues from the usa  researchers    
hummingbirds in nature exhibit expert engineering skills  the only birds capable of sustained hovering  a team from the us  british columbia  and the netherlands have completed tests to learn more about the hummingbird s    
it has taken more than a million fine samples of aerodynamic force and airflow combined to determine what makes a hummingbird s wings so adept at hovering 
it remains unclear to scientists why almost every rna binding protein has a sibling   or  paralog   while such sibling proteins have the same origins and are similar to each other in a number of ways  they are presumed to    
throughout evolutionary history  there have been genetic elements that have duplicated   giving rise to genes with different functions  these are called  paralogs   they are able to form and evolve new functions  which have    
much like motors power our cars  they also ensure that proteins get to the right place in our cells  and a wide variety of diseases   from cancer to heart problems   can result when they don t
