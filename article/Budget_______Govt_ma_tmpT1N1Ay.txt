new delhi  every cloud has a silver lining and the pain of demonetisation may get addressed after all  it seems the government is working towards a host of direct tax incentives  to be announced in the upcoming union budget  buoyed by increased tax collections due to demonetisation  this could mean lower personal income tax rates and lower corporate tax rates too  this piece quotes policy experts and people involved in the budget making process to indicate that the twin sops could be on their way 
the only catch in the feel good news is this  will there be a toss up between the personal income tax rates and corporate tax rates for a government which is still uncertain about the revenue mop up this fiscal  demonetsiation and its impact is still being assessed   and will hectic lobbying by india inc tilt the scales in favour of reduction in corporate tax rates 
corporate tax accounted for a little less than a fifth     percent  of the government   s receipts last fiscal whereas income tax receipts accounted for just    percent of total receipts  together  these two tax heads accounted for a third of government   s revenues  according to this piece of the total tax     rs           crore     collected by the central government last fiscal  corporate tax has the major share  though it has declined from    percent in         to estimated      percent in         
some taxation experts have expressed doubts about any move to lower personal it rates  one expert  who declined to be named  said that lowering income tax rates would go against the pro poor image which the modi government is quite keen to project  since this would mean relief to the    rich    but not for the    poor     this expert said all the talk about personal income tax rates being reduced is just that     talk     when the government may actually be focused on only reducing corporate taxes instead since this will provide tangible benefits  besides  industry has been assuring the government that if the headline rate becomes the effective tax rate in this case  overall tax revenue will actually get a boost if corporate tax is lowered  it stands at    percent now except for businesses with a turnover of less than rs   crore where it was relaxed in the last budget 
girish vanvari   partner and head of tax at kpmg  pointed out that the government needs to focus on lowering corporate taxes to boost job creation     personal income tax rates are unlikely to be lowered because reduction in corporate taxes will lead to job creation and there may be no further room for lowering personal taxes    
well  if personal income tax rates do come down  there would be all round cheer  ey   s tax partner  amp  mobility leader amarpal chadha said personal income tax rates could be eased in the budget     expectation  from the budget  is for the government to reduce the personal income tax rates or enhance the tax slabs  probably as an incentive  given that income disclosure scheme has resulted in additional revenue and the impact of demonetisation may bring in more taxpayers  one has to wait and watch as this year   s budget discussions progress     remember  the initial proposal under the direct tax code was to only tax income of    lakh and above at the rate of    percent 
the business standard piece quotes neeru ahuja  partner global business tax  deloitte as saying that    i am expecting something positive on the tax front in the budget to compensate people for the hurt caused by demonetisation      the government may increase some tax slabs to compensate people or come out with some incentives to save taxes  it might do to couple that with stricter and stringent enforcement provisions for non compliance    
but let us get back to corporate tax  that corporate tax reduction is very much a talking point this year is clear  it is at the top of india inc   s wishlist  according to a cii pre budget memorandum  the effective corporate tax rate is just      percent now  much lower than the headline rate  thanks to myriad exemptions   and india inc wants it lowered to      including all surcharges and cess  and has asked the government to withdraw all tax incentives  concessions etc 
   we believe that in the past when corporate tax has been lowered  corporate tax collection has gone up  an    percent corporate tax should therefore not lead to revenue loss to the government and at a stroke move us away from a high tax  high concession regime  this will bring india in line with the most attractive international investment destinations such as singapore  sri lanka  uk and turkey     cii said 
on personal income tax  cii has recommended that basic limit for exemption and other income slabs should be enhanced  it has quoted the parliamentary standing committee on finance   s report on the direct taxes code bill       dtc bill  and its recommendations on revised tax slabs for individual taxpayers  the chamber has suggested that the highest tax rate should be reduced to    percent against    percent now 
assocham has sought    immediate    reduction in the corporate tax to    percent to attract more investment in the country     while for driving the consumption led demand  income tax for individuals should also be reduced along with upward revision in the exemption limit upto rs   lakh    
the tax expert quoted earlier on had pointed out that tangible benefits would accrue to the economy by reduction in corporate taxes     not personal income tax rates  he said this single move would mean job creation and incentivising the manufacturing sector so that the overall economic growth is enhanced     what will lowering personal income tax achieve except conveying the message that the rich will have it easy    already  gst has strengthened the perception that tax inequality will increase since this tax will be equal for the rich and the poor     income tax rates won   t be tinkered with this time     he said 
as the budget making process gets underway  let us hope that the government is able to please both     the suits as well as the aam aadmi     specially after the flak it has been receiving for the demonetisation pain
