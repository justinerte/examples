you could call it a double whammy that is going to shake the world for a while  while the outcome of the us elections seems likely to create one kind of uncertainty  prime minister narendra modi s decision to demonetise rs     and rs       notes is striking deep not just into the black economy of india but also day to day economics  white is the new black in india  and this time  it is different  when india demonetised large notes in      and       the denominations in question were not small enough to touch commoners  we now live in times when rickshaw pullers and crony capitalists alike will be touched by the monetary coup that hit india on the night of tuesday  november   
here are five things indians need to watch out for in the coming days after a move that has social  political and economic implications 
   impact on banks and their balance sheets  india s banks may suddenly have more cash deposits  as those with currency bundles walk into deposit their money  this might be a short term boost for banks groaning under the impact of bad loans  or non performing assets  npas   as they are called in market jargon  more deposits in an atmosphere of decreasing inflation and interest rates mean lower cost of borrowings for banks  the more the deposits  the easier it is for them  though they will have to cope with a logistical nightmare as queues of currency seekers with id cars lengthen outside counters  at the end of june  npas as a share of gross loans for indian banks stood at         and in currency terms rs         crore 
   money laundering innovations to beat december    deadline  india is the land of jugaad  or improvised innovation  those stuck with piles of cash that they do not want to be investigated by the taxman may find  benami  ways to minimise the impact of the demonetisation on their lives  this may involve discounting mechanisms  a new kind of middlemen or new types of financial buffers  keep your ears to the ground as black money tries to get fair  amp  lovely  to borrow an expression from rahul gandhi  gold may see interesting movements  as it is a common black economy substitute for cash 
   real estate market behaviour  expect realtors and developers used to dealing in piles of cash with lower than market registration values to find new ways to deal with customers  they may  for instance  find new ways to invoice deals so that they get more white money in while they find sponges to absorb their black money  or they may lobby with the government for leniency or raise impediments to the implementation of the demonetisation scheme 
   arun jaitley s future  modi is the man who is in charge  but finance minister arun jaitley will come under a lens as his role in the coming months may need to shift from policy making to nitty gritty administration  as opposition parties mount pressure on how the common people are inconvenienced  day to day measures to clarify doubts and lower the pain points for industries  depositors  consumers and citizens in general will become important  there is a lobby within the bjp rss  sangh parivar  that has been suspicious of jaitley  they may turn hawkish 
   impact on modi s home base  small traders and medium sized business enterprises buzzing in the prime minister s home state  gujarat  are an integral part of india s black economy  for some  it is an inevitability of dealing with partners and cash rich customers  for others it is a way to avoid taxes  brokers  developers and financial intermediaries who have traditionally been modi supporters because of their conservative cultural leanings or market orientation may be inconvenienced by the demonetisation  will this sour a cosy political equation for the bjp in a stronghold
