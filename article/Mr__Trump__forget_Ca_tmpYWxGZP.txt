there he goes again  donald trump hasn   t even been sworn in yet and former president jimmy carter is urging president obama to recognize    palestine    before he leaves office 
in his recent new yorktimes op ed  carter reiterates his deep animus for israel by labeling         jewish residents of historic judea and samaria  aka west bank  as    colonists    
mr  president elect  forget jimmy carter  he long ago made his bed with the likes of fidel castro and other tyrants  and it was carter who has been the chief cheerleader to recognize hamas as a legitimate    political actor    
meanwhile secretary of state kerry  couldn   t go gently into the night  afp reported that    in unusually stark terms  mr  kerry warned that the building of israeli settlements was undermining any hope of an agreement to allow two states to live side by side

mr  trump  you have said you want to apply your unique negotiations skills to the israel palestinian dispute 
here are a few suggestions 
first     years is enough  make the move  it   s time to finally recognize jerusalem as israel   s capital and launch that shovel ready embassy project with trump like speed 
second  nbsp  send a message to the un  stop treating our ally israel as a whipping boy for the arab and muslim blocs    fanatic anti jewish hatred or america will re evaluate our future in the un human rights council  unesco  and unwra 
mr  president elect  you know its treacherous record on the holy land  its ineffectiveness in stopping the slaughter in syria  its silence over ethnic cleansing of christians in iraq  nbsp  yet  it is only israel  not syria or iran   that continuously suffers diplomatic assaults  with jerusalem recently targeted by    un resolutions in one day 
unesco  the u n    s anointed protector of world heritage  caved to arab pressure and just voted twice to erase jewish history by recasting judaism   s holiest sites   held holy also by christians   as muslim 
third  mr  trump  tell the french you will veto any security council resolution demanding israel to withdraw to its june      borders  those lines  dubbed    auschwitz borders    by the late foreign minister abba eban  would immediately put   million israeli citizens within range of cross border suicide bombers and over         missiles  no nation would ever place its people in such jeopardy  and no israeli leader will 
mr  president elect  you can build a new paradigm for peace by doing something no previous us president has ever done  deliver some tough love to the palestinians 
fourth  call for an end to hamas rule in gaza  the world talks of a two state solution  but so long as terrorist hamas rules gaza  israel would be forced to accept a    state solution  nbsp  for decades now  in word and deed hamas has been totally committed to a genocidal end to the jewish state  they cynically place the people of gaza in harm   s way  intertwining civilian infrastructure with their military terrorist complex  they steal construction materials earmarked for civilian reconstruction to expand its underground terrorist tunnels to attack israel  still  international aid continues to pour in and few protest their anti semitic invective and continued calls to    remove all jews    
mr  trump  you can lead the way in putting an end to this madness  denounce hamas    serial terrorism and criminality  demand their international enablers to stop funding hamastan  it is time the world heard from the white house that it is hamas  not    settlements      that is a real obstacle to peace 
fifth  demand from the palestinian authority  pa  to start behaving like it wants peace  mr  president elect  peace partners don   t name schools honoring the leader of the black september group that murdered eleven israeli athletes at the      munich olympics 
president abbas should be told there will be no more funding for pa curricula that fail to teach coexistence with jewish neighbors  in       palestinian textbooks are rife with anti jewish invective  a fact overlooked by an obama white house memo that gave these books a clean bill of health 
and shouldn   t recipients of america   s and europe   s largess hold accountable the adults who gave two   year old palestinian children knives  then drove the kids to nahal oz and told them to go kill jews 
mr  president elect  all   year olds  jewish  christian  and muslim  deserve a peaceful future 
your leadership can bring real hope to the holy land by speaking the truth  demand that hamas be removed from ruling gaza and make clear that there is one main obstacle standing between palestinians and a peaceful future  hate
