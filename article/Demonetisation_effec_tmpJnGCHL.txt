it was only time that all india bakchod   aib  released a satirical take on the demonetisation effect  their video covers almost all the ground  addressing the diverse range of issues and conjectures that have flooded the public discourse in the past few weeks 
the video starts with how three classes   the rich  the common man and the bank employees   have reacted to the move  the rich  represented by the director of the video tanmay bhat  are depicted as fooling their domestic helps by handing them the old rs     note  storing their black money in the form of gold and ordering their servants to stand in the bank queues to exchange the old currency notes with the new ones 
on the other hand  the person representing the middle class  is seen complaining to a chaiwallah  no brownie points for guessing whom this figure represents  only to have his complaints fall on the deaf ears of the tea seller 
watch out for the bit when the man snaps at the chaiwallah by saying   tu chai bech na  politics me kyun ghus raha hai    why don t you sell tea  stop getting into politics    yet another indirect message to  the one who must not be named  
the bank employee is seen sweating it out by managing the frenzy in the banks  he is also shown complaining about overtime and working on sundays and at the same time  he is busy delaying the customers in a part which gets a bit stretched  however  the exaggeration is used as an ornamental device in the video in order to denote the extent to which the central government has been unreasonable in the execution of demonetisation  also  watch out for a shirtless special cameo by fitness expert ranveer allahbadia in the climax scene 
the highlight of the video is how the poor has been ignored or not represented in society  a poor man appears intermittently in the video and is seen trying to embrace the change by coping up with all the hassles that demonetisation brought  he does so keeping in consideration the greater good of the country but succumbs to weakness in the climax and dies consequently  the people around him in a bank queue get emotional for a few seconds before they run back to the counter at the announcement of the arrival of bundles of the new rs     notes 
thus  aib s satirical take on demonetisation encompasses almost all the issues related to the historic move by prime minister narendra modi  it highlights the fact that while people are hopeful about the decision as a solution to the black money plague  demonetisation might not be india s cup of tea for dealing with this widespread evil
