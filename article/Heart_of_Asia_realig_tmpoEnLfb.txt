in diplomacy  the subtext is often as important as the text  as the sixth edition of the annual heart of asia conference came to a close on sunday  between the comments and declarations  the narrative and the counter narrative  lay the contours of a new  deviatory foreign policy under prime minister narendra modi 
a nation s strategic affairs are usually the result of well curated gradualism  major shifts are rare unless there is a confluence of circumstances and a strong leadership willing to shake off hesitations of history  at the end of the two day summit  it does appear that india is on the cusp of a bold revision  two things are immediately clear 
one  india is no longer coy about its relationship with afghanistan and sees the central asian nation as an important pivot  two  it is fast recalibrating its historic ties with russia  we are still a long way away from hearing the last word of an enduring strategic partnership but new delhi is close to accepting  after staying in long denial  that the cold war era bonhomie with moscow is over  indo russian ties  too  have fallen prey to the sweeping currents of realignment triggered by the end of american exceptionalism and the simultaneous rise of china 
though major regional and global players met in amritsar ostensibly to guide afghanistan through its political and economic transition  in reality heart of asia platform was reduced to staging just another boxing bout between india  pakistan and afghanistan with russia trying to play the referee and media in islamabad and new delhi in breathless anticipation for resumption of talks 
as if that would serve any purpose 
the way the pugilists threw their punches  it became abundantly clear that kabul and new delhi now see no point in downplaying the convergence of their strategic and commercial interests  in setting diplomatic niceties aside and blasting pakistan s complicity in sponsoring terror within its borders and inflicting an  undeclared war   afghanistan president ashraf ghani reflected his growing frustration with a delinquent neighbour  the ferocity of his charge not only laid bare pakistan s duplicity but also ratified new delhi s line on cross border terrorism 
this growing closeness stays true to a trajectory in bilateral relations that saw new delhi supply afghanistan with four attack helicopters  the first supply of lethal military hardware to the afghan national defense and security forces  andsf   as a defenseworld net article points out   the first three mi    gunships were delivered in december       before modi visited kabul to inaugurate the new parliament  constructed through india s assistance  
these russian made choppers are expected to aid afghan air force in their battle against the taliban who still occupy    percent of territory and is in direct confrontation with afghan forces for control over another    percent of land  ghani accuses pakistan of harbouring taliban masterminds and reiterated before a full house of foreign delegates in amritsar that were it not been for islamabad s duplicity  the taliban wouldn t last even a month 
quoting a taliban leader  the afghanistan president said     as kakazada  mullah rahmatullah kakazada   one of the key figures in the taliban movement  recently said  if they did not have sanctuary in pakistan  they would not last a month     according to a report in the indian express  in words that leave no space for ambiguity  ghani rejected pakistan s      million pledge to  rebuild afghanistan  and asked its foreign affairs advisor sartaj aziz to instead use the money to  check extremism  on its soil 
ghani didn t stop there  according to the report  he accused pakistan of selectively displacing terror networks in north waziristan  betraying afghanistan s trust and inflicting on its soil a war that has grown in intensity during      and has caused the highest number of civilian casualties and military related deaths in the world 
in contrast  ghani was effusive in his praise for india  news agency pti quoted the afghan president as saying that  india s assistance is transparent and with no strings attached    there are no hidden deals between india and afghanistan   he also mentioned the  spontaneous celebrations  all over the country following the inauguration of salma dam by modi during his afghanistan visit and thanked india for further assistance of    billion apart from    billion 
though pakistan has long felt insecure about an india afghanistan axis that circumvents it and renders ineffective its geostrategic positioning  islamabad s obstructionist policies     refusing to let afghanistan carry on trade with india through its territory     and subversive use of terror have ironically served to catalyse the very thing it dreads  there is now an even greater likelihood     with modi and ghani meeting on the sidelines and agreeing on a joint air corridor to bypass pakistan and enhance bilateral trade     that the relationship will now be taken to the next level 
a commercial strategic tie up with afghanistan     whose unique position as a central asian country that provides connectivity to several asian and even european nations     may offer india the chance to counter china s strategic depth through the cpec 
and in ghani  modi has a counterpart who s willing to take india on board  while talking later to suhasini haidar of the hindu during an interview  ghani said   india is converging with afghanistan  there is nothing secret  it is a transparent state to state relationship  we are driven by common goals and opportunities   he even quoted tagore s kabuliwala to underline the historic bond between the nations 
but while one historic bond is being revived  another one fell by the wayside  in an extraordinary manouvre that reflected the depths of disparity in which indo russian ties have fallen  vladimir putin s envoy zamir kabulov rejected india and afghainstan s criticism of pakistan and lectured on the need to  avoid scoring brownie points  on multilateral platforms such as these 
pakistan media expectedly went to town with kabulov s statements but it became clear where the shoe pinches when a question was posed on the russia pakistan military exercise     india has close cooperation with the us  does moscow complain  then why complain about much lower level of cooperation with pakistan     he said 
foreign affairs are based on narrow self interests  not foggy sentimentality  it makes sense for russia  whose relationship with the us is at an all time low since the cold war  to migrate to a more sino centric axis  that shouldn t discourage india from pursuing its own self interests  in coming out in the open over its relationship with afghanistan  modi has taken the right step
