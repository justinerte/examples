italian prime minister matteo renzi announced his resignation early monday  sending shock waves around europe  after he was handed a resounding defeat in a referendum by anti establishment voters 
the prime minister       s plan to slash the power of the italian senate to speed up lawmaking was voted down sunday by about     of voters  according to early results  marking another victory for populism in the wake of britain       s        brexit        and donald trump       s triumph in the united states 
       i assume all the responsibility for this defeat         renzi said  acknowledging a        clear        victory by his opponents  he said he would hand in his resignation later monday to president sergio mattarella 
       the experience of my government ends here         he said 
turnout was high by italian standards  at nearly      after a tough campaign that saw politicians trading insults while voters struggled to understand the fine print of the changes to the constitution required by renzi       s reforms 
the proposed changes would have reduced the number of senators in parliament from     to      and would have meant that most laws could be passed without senate approval 
mattarella may ask renzi to seek a vote of confidence in parliament and form a new government 
opposition nbsp  was led by the anti establishment five star movement  whose founder  comedian beppe grillo  claimed  nbsp the changes would hand unprecedented power to the italian government while crippling the country       s checks and balances  grillo asked italians  quot to vote with your gut  not your brain  quot 
among other things  the five star movement wants italy to drop the  euro currency 
matteo salvini  leader of the anti migrant northern league party and a        no        vote campaigner  said before casting his ballot  that he hoped to emulate        the revenge of the people        that led to trump       s victory 
european leaders had lined up to back renzi  and the result was seen by some as heralding a period of political instability that could make italy       s ailing  debt laden banks a potential flashpoint for a run on europe       s fragile finances  nbsp 
attention will focus on the world       s oldest bank  monte  dei paschi di siena  which urgently needs to raise   billion euros         an operation that may come unstuck if investors now give italy a wide berth 
european far right populist movements energized by britain s  brexit  vote and trump s victory  raquo 
marcello messori  an economics professor at rome       s luiss university  expressed hope that the shock to the markets could be        absorbed rapidly        if a new government can be formed quickly 
       mattarella will prefer renzi to carry on governing to minimize the political fallout  but renzi won       t want to be seen to be clinging on to power at any cost  so he may refuse         said roberto d       alimonte  a professor of politics at luiss 
       if he does  mattarella could decide to ask someone from renzi       s democratic party to form a government  or may appoint a        technocrat        government of experts         he said 
before new elections are held  possibly as soon as next spring  a new administration will be tasked with writing a new electoral law  since the current rules drawn up by renzi       s government only apply to the lower house  so convinced were its framers that the referendum would annul the senate 
after becoming mayor of florence at     renzi engineered a backroom coup within the center left democratic party to take over as prime minister in       bringing bold promises to shake up italy       s bloated parliament and creaking legal system 
two and half years later  the self styled        demolition man        had failed to lift italy out of its economic slide  which has seen industrial output decline by a quarter since       that failure encouraged voters to use the referendum to punish him 
along the way  he also lost his reputation as italy       s anti establishment scrapper to grillo 
       our parliament is an expression of the will of the people  yet this reform makes the government the center of power  able to control parliament         said rome office manager giuseppe cesaro before voting sunday 
maurizio molinari  editor of italian daily la stampa  said italy was now the third country to be hit by the anti establishment vote  after britain and the united states 
       we have seen a population in revolt in our country too  quot  he said
