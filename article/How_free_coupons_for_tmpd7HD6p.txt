horizon pharma charges more than nbsp        for a month       s supply of a prescription pain reliever that is the combination of two cheap drugs available separately over the counter 
another company  novum  sells a small tube of a prescription skin rash cream  containing two inexpensive decades old medicines  for nearly        
what is key to the companies        business plan of raising prices by        or more   nbsp 
the answer  coupons that deliver horizon       s pain reliever vimovo and novum       s skin cream alcortin a for as little as nothing to the patient  while leaving america       s health system to pick up much of the rest of the price 
experts warn that the coupons  increasingly being used by dozens of companies  are sharply adding to the nation       s medicine bill  that cost is passed along to most americans through higher insurance premiums and taxes needed to pay for government health programs 
the success of horizon and novum using this strategy demonstrates how america       s convoluted and opaque system of paying for prescription drugs enables executives to set extraordinary prices on modest medicines that have been around for years  the coupons keep patients and doctors from seeing the medicine       s true price tag 
 nbsp        via a coupon  the manufacturer can make its high priced drug look as cheap as these over the counter medicines         explained matt schmitt  an assistant professor at the ucla anderson school of management 
in two recent papers  schmitt  along with professors from harvard and northwestern  showed how the coupons propelled companies to charge        the highest price possible        
they found that spending on    medicines sold through coupons was as much as      billion higher over five years than it would have been if the coupons were not used 
in       a quarter of sales from brand name medicines came from drugs backed by co pay coupons  the group said  by       that proportion had more than doubled and        the availability of coupons has since become rampant         they said 
by boosting prices  companies can bolster revenue nbsp without spending more on research to discover new medicines  horizon  for example  has increased the price of vivomo eight times in the last two years  the price hikes lift the corporate bottom line  and often executives        compensation 
last year  horizon       s board handed chief executive timothy walbert a pay package worth       million         a    fold rise from the previous year 
novum  founded last year and owned by a small group of investors who don       t release financial figures  has sold more than     million worth of alcortin a this year through the end of july  according to quintilesims  which tracks drug spending  before novum bought the drug from another company  the prescription skin cream       s annual sales were less than    million 
of the three medicines novum sells  alcortin a is by far its most popular 
in answers to questions sent by email  geoffrey curtis  horizon       s senior vice president of corporate communications  said the coupons help patients get needed medicines 
       our goal is to provide access to medicines a patient       s physician prescribes while limiting the patients        financial burden         curtis said 
he said the wholesale price of the company       s pain reliever vimovo        is not reflective of the cost to patients        
rand walton  a spokesman for novum  declined to answer questions about its skin cream  in a statement  walton said novum was owned        by a group of like minded investors who believe in the company       s business model to provide no hassle and affordable access to therapies        
some patient advocacy groups support industry coupons  a position that has somewhat muffled the outcry over soaring medicine prices  nbsp 
       co pay coupons are something our case managers will continue to use until there       s no need for them         said caitlin donovan at the national patient advocate foundation  the group  which is partly funded by drug companies  runs a program to help patients pay for medicines 
alcortin a is a combination of hydrocortisone and an antibacterial drug called iodoquinol         both discovered many decades ago  the gel also includes a compound from the aloe vera plant  similar to what is sold to soothe sunburn  its label explains that it is        possibly        effective for eczema and other skin conditions 
horizon       s vimovo is a combination of naproxen  the generic pain reliever sold under the brand name aleve  and the generic version of the heartburn medicine nexium  both are available over the counter  some doctors suggest taking the two medicines together to try to avoid stomach ulcers  a dangerous side effect of pain relievers  like aleve  known as nsaids 
the wholesale  or list price of vimovo is     per tablet  the pain reliever is taken twice daily for a total cost of      if a patient instead bought naproxen and nexium over the counter at the drugstore  a day       s worth of medicine would cost as little as    cents 
horizon bought the rights to sell vimovo and quickly raised its price for    tablets from      to      on jan  nbsp          according to data from truven health analytics  nbsp  after seven more price hikes  the drug now sells for        
curtis  the horizon executive  said the combination drug is worth its price because it lowers a pain patient       s risk of potentially deadly ulcers         to assume that you can substitute otc  over the counter  and or generic medicines sequentially is inaccurate         he wrote in an email 
the strategy of purchasing an older medicine and hiking its price has become so common in the pharmaceutical industry that wall street analysts call it        buy and raise        
last year  executives from valeant pharmaceuticals international and turing pharmaceuticals were called before a congressional committee to explain their large price hikes on medicines purchased from other companies   nbsp 
novum bought the rights to sell alcortin a in the spring of      and soon hiked its price from      to         according to truven  the price jumped to        in january and to        on sept     
experts say it would be far more difficult for drug companies to aggressively boost prices without the coupons  they defeat one of the few tools that the nation       s health system has to try to stop doctors from prescribing high priced medicines not worth their cost 
insurers often put higher co payments or co pays         the fixed payment made by a patient         on expensive  brand name drugs in an attempt to get patients to take cheaper generic alternatives  with the coupons  though  patients and doctors don       t have to worry about those higher co pays 
but experts say widespread use of the coupons leads to overall higher premiums         this is raising the cost to everyone         said steve miller  chief medical officer at express scripts  the nation       s largest manager of prescription drug benefits for insurers and employers 
last year  drug costs for patients covered by private insurance policies rose nearly      according to the s amp p global institute 
patients can find the coupons on internet sites and in drug ads in magazines  pharmaceutical salespeople deliver handfuls of them nbsp to doctors        offices  consulting firms embed the coupons on electronic prescribing services so that doctors see them on their mobile devices 
the coupons are submitted to the pharmacy with the patient       s prescription  the drug companies have hired firms that specialize in making the process fast and easy for patients and physicians 
horizon said it spent more than    billion last year on coupons and other financial assistance for patients 
the companies        coupon strategy only works if insurers continue to include the drugs on their lists of covered medicines  known as formularies  and pay for the cost that the coupons don       t cover 
some insurers  including express scripts  have tried to put up roadblocks to the exorbitantly priced drugs by removing them from their formularies 
but horizon and other companies have learned how to keep the number of prescriptions rising despite the cutoff from some insurers 
with the help of electronic prescribing systems  horizon has doctors send the medicine order with a few taps on their mobile device to mail order pharmacies that the company has partnered with  according to its annual report filed in       the pharmacy ships the pills to patients overnight 
the mail order pharmacies fill nbsp out paperwork required by insurers when doctors say patients need medicines that have been excluded from the formulary 
horizon executives have explained to investors and analysts that fewer prescriptions have been rejected for payment by insurers when they are sent through the mail order pharmacies 
miller at express scripts said the firm had found the mail order pharmacies resubmitting claims that had originally been rejected  the drug is so inexpensive to manufacture  he said  that if just some of the prescriptions are eventually approved for payment by insurers the companies still make money 
       this is people profiteering off sick individuals         miller said         it       s very unfortunate        
doctors wrote more than        prescriptions for vimovo in the first three months of the year  according to horizon  that was     more than in those same months the year before 
curtis said the decision of which pharmacy to use was        between the physician and the patient        
as an incentive to use the mail order pharmacy  horizon guarantees that the patient will receive those prescriptions even if the insurer doesn       t pay 
breast cancer action  a patient advocacy group that does not accept donations from drug companies  opposes the coupons  saying they can lead patients to choose a medicine with higher risks or that is not best for their condition 
       they allow corporations to look like good corporate citizens         said karuna jaggar  the san francisco based group       s executive director  but are actually        a thinly veiled program to drive up revenue        
       coupons are not the answer        to high drug prices  jaggar said         there should be cost controls to make sure patients aren       t being left out        
the industry doesn       t give coupons to patients covered by medicare or other federal healthcare programs  that       s because the federal government has long viewed the coupons as illegal kickbacks given to get doctors to prescribe high priced drugs 
that ban has created harsh surprises for some patients who say they need the drugs 
jim mccamphill      of venice  fla   said alcortin a is the only medication that works for a recurring skin rash 
his doctor gave him a free sample  he said  but now  even though he tries to limit his use  mccamphill said he is running out  his pharmacist told him nbsp that for medicare patients who can       t use a coupon  the next tube would cost        
       it       s a question of do you eat or do you put on an ointment         mccamphill said         it       s a disgrace  the system is so skewed  it       s scary
