jayalalithaa and sports in tamil nadu
sportspersons in tamil nadu will forever remain indebted to former chief minister j jayalalithaa for quite a few reasons  it is her far sightedness that resulted in chennai getting some impressive sporting arenas including the jawaharlal nehru stadium and the tennis stadium  nbsp 
from a city that was starved of top flight sporting action to a hub of activity  that is the story of chennai  and  a lot of credit for that goes to jayalalithaa  she has been the driving force behind improving sports infrastructure in the city and other parts of the state  nbsp 
she was instrumental in chennai hosting the prestigious world chess championship match between home favourite vishy anand and magnus carlsen  jayalalithaa allocated rs    crore for conduct of the world title match  which went on to become hugely followed  nbsp 
it was a momentous occasion for fans in these parts got to watch india     s own legend in action against a prodigious talent  whose stock was rising  nbsp  she took personal interest in conduct of the mega event and was present at the opening ceremony and drew the lots for choice of colour and gave away the prizes at the valedictory  nbsp 
that is not all  jayalalithaa     s role in helping the city retain hosting rights of the atp tournament can     t be overemphasised  it must be recalled that at a time when the event looked in the limbo as the original sponsor backed out in       she stepped in and announced that the tamilnadu government would step in to ensure it went on without any hitch  the government has since been one of the platinum sponsors and has been a key mover behind the championship     s conduct with jayalalithaa     s guidance

at a psychological level  this is also because of the      queen king and subject      relationship that leaders like jayalalithaa developed with the people of tamil nadu

tamil nadu chief minister j jayalalithaa  a popular leader who pioneered pro poor programmes and remained a pole for three decades  died here tonight leaving a big void in the state politcs  the    year old leader  who suffered a massive cardiac arrest on sunday evening  passed away at       pm on monday tonight  after battling for life for    days  the apollo hospitals said in a statement 
two hours after the announcement of her death  in a swift political transition  her loyalist o panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister at a sombre ceremony at the raj bhawan along with all the ministers in the erstwhile jayalalithaa cabinet 
panneerselvam had stepped into her shoes twice earlier when she was convicted in corruption cases  as finance minister  he was given charge of the portfolios held by jayalalithaa after her admission to apollo hospitals on    september 
in his third stint in the top office  o panneerselvam was today sworn in as chief minister of tamil nadu hours after his predecessor and party supremo j jayalalithaa passed away after a prolonged illness 
a grim faced panneerselvam  who was also seen sporting a beard  was sworn in around      am by governor ch vidyasagar rao at the raj bhavan amidst a scene of gloom  after he took oath of office  a total of    ministers  all of them members of the previous jayalalithaa cabinet  took oath in a simultaneous swearing in 
panneerselvam was administered the oath of office and secrecy by rao  who air dashed here from mumbai yesterday after jayalalithaa suffered a cardiac arrest  panneerselvam       often hailed as jayalalithaa s  man friday   took oath in the name of god 
even as her death was announced  the aiadmk mlas met at the party headquarters to elect panneerselvam as the successor to jayalalithaa 
jayalalithaa  who scored a historic win in the assembly elections in the state little over six months ago  was admitted to apollo hospitals on september    with fever and dehydration but she could never recover 
a tinsel heroine  who inherited the legacy of her mentor late mgr  had entered politics in the early     s as the propaganda secretary of aiadmk and was made the incharge of the noon meal scheme undertaken by the mgr government 
born in a brahmin family  jayalalithaa emerged as a fiesty leader in a state where forces of social justice had thrown up an anti brahmin political movement even before independence 
she practised politics on her own terms and was one of the two poles in the state for nearly    years fighting the dmk headed by redoubtable m karunanidhi 
only hours earlier in the evening  the hospital had denied reports that jayalalithaa had died as  baseless and false  when tv channels said she was no more 
 it is with indescribable grief  we announce the sad demise of our esteemed honourable chief minister of tamil nadu puratchi thalaivi amma at       pm today   apollo hospitals said in a statement 
 our honourable chief minister selvi j jayalalithaa was admitted on           with complaints of fever and dehydration and underlying co morbidities  the honourable chief minister responded well to the multi disciplinary care in the critical care unit and subsequently recovered substantially to being able to take food orally 
 on this basis  honourable chief minister was shifted from the advanced critical care unit to the high dependency unit  where her health and vitals continued to improve under the close monitoring by our expert panel of specialists  
unfortunately  the hospital release said  the chief minister suffered a massive cardiac arrest on the evening of december   even while the intensivist was in her room  the chief minister was immediately administered rescusitation  cpr  and provided ecmo support within the hour 
ecmo is the most advanced treatment currently available internationally  every possible clinical attempt was made to sustain her revival  however  despite our best efforts  the chief minister s underlying conditions rendered her unable to recover and she passed away at       pm on monday  the release said 
a five time chief minister  jayalalithaa pioneered a string of social sector schemes like  cradle to baby scheme  aimed at fighting the curse of female foeticide  free gold coins for those who begot girl child 
she also opened a series of public welfare schemes under brand amma  as she was popularly called  like  amma canteens  to low priced food to the urban poor  there were similar schemes for the poor like  amma salt   amma water  and  amma medicines  
jayalalithaa also attracted investment  especially from abroad  in sectors like automobile and it 
a host of leaders including president pranab mukherjee  vice president hamid ansari  prime minister narendra modi  congress chief sonia gandhi  vice president rahul  home minister rajnath singh and a number of film personalities expressed grief over her death 
modi  who shared good political equation with jayalalisthaa said he was deeply saddened at her passing away which has left a  huge void  in indian politics 
 i will always cherish the innumerable occasions when i had the opportunity to interact with jayalalithaa ji  may her soul rest in peace   he said
