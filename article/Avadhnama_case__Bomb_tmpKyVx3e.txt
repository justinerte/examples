 the bombay high court on monday stopped the police from filing a charge sheet against shireen dalvi  the editor of the now defunct mumbai edition of avadhnama  an urdu daily 
dalvi is facing a probe after seven firs were registered against her in january      for obscenity and offending religious sentiments 
on january    last year  dalvi had reproduced on the front page of her paper  the cover of the french magazine charlie hebdo 
a huge furore ensued  and even though dalvi issued a front page apology the next morning  people from across the state got police complaints registered against her and the paper 
on monday  dalvi rsquo s counsel  senior advocate mihir desai  told hc that there was  ldquo no malice rdquo  in dalvi rsquo s decision to reproduce the controversial cover with a caricature of prophet mohammed lamenting about fundamentalists 
desai argued that dalvi had instead  wanted to reproduce another cover from charlie hebdo  mdash  one that quoted the pope rsquo s remarks on limits to freedom of expression 
besides  he argued  even with the cover  neither the poster  not dalvi had  ldquo deliberately intended to hurt someone rsquo s religious sentiments  rdquo  he said that since then  the paper had shut down  dalvi and her family had been harassed  and she had lost her income 
the police  meanwhile  submitted that considering that firs had been lodged across the state   ldquo further investigation was required  rdquo 
a bench of justice vm kanade and justice nutan sardessai questioned the police rsquo s decision to charge dalvi not just under section     a of the ipc for having  lsquo deliberately offended one rsquo s religious beliefs or sentiments  rsquo  but also under section     for  lsquo obscenity  rsquo 
the bench said that it will deliberate upon the charges on the next hearing and no charge sheet must be filed until further orders 
hc is likely to take up the matter in january next year
