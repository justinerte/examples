the thirty eight flight of isro       s workhorse rocket  pslv c   is scheduled for a december   launch from the first launch pad  flp    at satish dhawan space centre shar  sriharikota  the xl configuration will be used for the mission  where the pslv is strapped on with six additional motors  pslv c   will place the resourcesat  a into     kilometre high polar sun synchronous orbit  sso  
the resourcesat  a is a remote sensing satellite meant to monitor resources  resourcesat  a is a follow on mission to the resourcesat launched in      and the resourcesat   launched in       the remote sensing data services is provided to a users around the world 
there are three remote sensing payloads on board the resourcesat  a  the  linear imaging self scanner  liss    high resolution camera  operating in three spectral bands in the visible and near infrared region  vnir   the resolution of the camera is     metres  the liss   camera has a swath of    kilometres and revisit every five days    the swatch is the area on the ground under observation  and the revisit period is the duration after which the same spot on the ground is observed by the imaging instrument 
a second payload is the liss   camera with an image resolution of      metres  the liss   captures images in three spectral bands in the vnir  as well as one spectral band in the short wave infrared region   swir   the liss   has a swath of     kilometres and a revisit of    days  the third payload is the advanced wide field sensor  awifs  camera operating in three bands in vnir and one band in swir  the spatial resolution on this camera is relatively low  at only    metres  the swatch of the awifs payload is     kilometres  and has a revisit of   days  the data rates for all the payloads are     mbps 
on board are two solid state recorders with a storage capacity of     giga bits each  the recorders are meant to store images from the sensors  to beam to the ground stations later  there are four stages to the rocket  the separation of the satellite will happen eighteen minutes after the launch  the rocket will achieve a top speed of       metres per second 
the pslv has seen thirty six successful launches so far  and has been putting  satellites into orbit since       and is available to foreign countries and corporations for launches  out of the     satellites launched by pslv     are foreign satellites  and    are indian satellites  pslv has placed satellites in polar ssos  low earth orbits  leo   geosynchronous transfer orbit  gto  as well as sub gtos
