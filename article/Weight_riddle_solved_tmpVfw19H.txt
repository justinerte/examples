weight riddle solved by stanford bird wing test

apart from developing an instrument for drones  the stanford team s investigation helps solve a riddle  said bbc news on wednesday  a riddle about flying birds  weight  does a container or truck carrying birds change in weight when the birds inside are flying  or  to say it in the telegraph s use of english   would a lorry carrying pigeons change weight if they all decided to fly   one conclusion was reached in an episode of a us television show  said bbc news  a trailer was weighed while birds flew inside it  the answer was that it made no difference to when the birds were still  the stanford team s device produced a different answer   the weight of the container would actually change as the birds flapped their wings   said the bbc  lentink  quoted in the telegraph  said  you need an unpractical number of bird to cancel the fluctuations out   looking from wingbeat to wingbeat  he said  one sees a lot of fluctuation  the weight of a truck containing just a few flying birds will fluctuate in time  only the lift of an incoherent flock of birds could cancel out  this change    he said in bbc news  hovering created double the lift during the wings  downstroke  the birds had no need to lift their weight in the upstroke  
the device is described in journal of the royal society interface   in vivo recording of aerodynamic force with an aerodynamic force platform  from drones to birds  is by david lentink  andreas haselsteiner and rivers ingersoll  from the department of mechanical engineering at stanford  how they tested  they recorded the tiny forces from a single bird flying inside a specially designed chamber  they trained two pacific parrotlets to fly from one perch to another and they examined the aerodynamic forces  
hummingbirds in nature exhibit expert engineering skills  the only birds capable of sustained hovering  a team from the us  british columbia  and the netherlands have completed tests to learn more about the hummingbird s    
 phys org     the sight of a tiny hummingbird hovering in front of a flower and then darting to another with lightning speed amazes and delights  but it also leaves watchers with a persistent question  how do they do it 
 phys org     new research published today in proceedings of the royal society b demonstrates that the secret of bumblebees  capacity for lifting relatively heavy loads lies in the flexibility of their wings 
bats appear to use a network of hair thin muscles in their wing skin to control the stiffness and shape of their wings as they fly  according to a new study  the finding provides new insight about the aerodynamic fine tuning    
the next time you see birds flying in a v  consider this  a new study says they choreograph the flapping of their wings with exquisite precision to help them on their way 
how did the earliest birds take wing  did they fall from trees and learn to flap their forelimbs to avoid crashing  or did they run along the ground and pump their  arms  to get aloft 
 phys org    there isn t as much dark matter around today as there used to be  according to one of the most popular models of dark matter  the universe contained much more dark matter early on when the temperature was hotter     
in       electrical engineering pioneers nick holonyak  jr  and milton feng at the university of illinois invented the transistor laser   a three port device that incorporated quantum wells in the base and an optical cavity   increasing    
although a lot of time and effort in particle physics are devoted to finding ways to increase the energy of certain experiments  sometimes it is even more important to find ways to safely  quickly and easily remove energy    
matter is either gas  liquid or solid based on how its molecules respond to temperature and pressure  but what if the building blocks are self spinning particles instead of ordinary molecules  theoretical physicists found    
experiments using laser light and pieces of gray material the size of fingernail clippings may offer clues to a fundamental scientific riddle  what is the relationship between the everyday world of classical physics and the    
 phys org    a team of researchers at the tata institute of fundamental research in india has found that cooling a sample of bismuth to         kelvin caused the material to become a superconductor  putting at risk a decades old
