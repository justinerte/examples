from an indian context  gen qamar javed bajwa rsquo s assumption of the post of pakistan army chief ominously coincided with a brazen attack on an indian army camp at nagrota in jammu and kashmir that left seven soldiers dead 
there was even speculation the assault was a parting shot from the outgoing army chief  gen raheel sharif  who had warned that his country rsquo s restraint and patience on kashmir should not be mistaken for weakness 
the developments in nagrota and chamliyal  where three infiltrators were killed  were in marked contrast to bajwa rsquo s remark at the change of command ceremony in rawalpindi that the situation on the line of control  loc   ldquo will be alright rdquo  soon 
the throwaway comment suggested bajwa  who has served on the loc and once commanded the rawalpindi based x corps that is responsible for operations along the ceasefire line  could adopt an approach different from that of sharif 
according to former colleagues  bajwa rsquo s keen interest in india goes back to his days as a young major serving on the loc in       that was when  they say  he began reading about india and discussing developments in the neighbouring country and the region with other officers 
and the buzz in islamabad is that bajwa was a beneficiary of a debate on whether the new army chief should be a general who focussed on the counter terrorism drive started by sharif  or someone who balanced the campaign against militants with a renewed focus on india  given his extensive expertise in kashmir affairs  bajwa was a natural fit when the pakistani leadership chose the second option 
brig  retired  feroz hassan khan  who was bajwa rsquo s commanding officer on the loc  says the man in what is usually seen as the most powerful position in pakistan does not have a  ldquo visceral hatred rdquo  of india 
 ldquo there is an assumption that every pakistani military officer who rises has some sort of a visceral hatred towards india  as if it rsquo s a default  this is not the case with  bajwa  and i can tell you he has studied india so much  rdquo  khan told hindustan times on phone from monterey  california  where he teaches at the us naval postgraduate school 
bajwa  with whom khan has stayed in touch over the years   ldquo understands india  and  reads a lot of what india writes and knows a lot about what india thinks rdquo   he added   ldquo there rsquo s hardly any senior officer of his level who reads a lot of what is published in india and he studies  he reflects and he remembers  rdquo 
bajwa also believes in striking a civil military balance and giving space to the elected government  khan said   ldquo the complexity of the issues hellip demand that neither the army can do it alone and nor the civilians can do it alone  so you have to balance the civil military relations  rdquo  said khan  the author of the highly regarded book eating grass  the making of the pakistani bomb  
 ldquo i think  bajwa  is one person who realises the heavy responsibility that comes on his shoulders  rdquo 
khan  however  noted bajwa had taken over at a difficult time  tensions between india and pakistan have spiked because of a string of terror attacks on the pathankot airbase and army camps at uri and nagrota  fierce exchanges of fire on the loc have put severe strain on the    year old ceasefire along the frontiers in kashmir 
 ldquo if he inherits something with so much tension on the border  he is first and foremost chief of the pakistan army  he has to do his duty  rdquo  khan said 
despite its recent focus on targeting  ldquo bad militants rdquo  such as the taliban  the pakistan army largely remains  ndash  as former army chief ashfaq kayani once put it  ndash  an  ldquo india centric rdquo  force  the military also retains a tight grip on key aspects of foreign and security policies  especially relations with countries such as the us and india 
pakistan rsquo s recent weapons purchases  ndash  including f    jets from the us and frigates and submarines from china  ndash  and a rejig of defence ties with russia have all been done with an eye to countering india rsquo s conventional military strength 
lt gen  retired  kamal davar  the first chief of india rsquo s defence intelligence agency  is among the skeptics who believes that a change of guard will not necessarily lead to a change of heart in the pakistan army 
 ldquo an army rsquo s stance emerges from national strategies and national interests  and the chief of any army is responsible for implementing those policies  strategies don rsquo t change because of a change of personality  rdquo  davar told hindustan times 
 ldquo i think pakistan rsquo s current operational strategies aren rsquo t going to change at all  besides  there rsquo s a difference between tactical and strategic matters  and an army chief wouldn rsquo t be directly involved in tactical stuff  rdquo  he added  referring to the attack in nagrota 
the jury  therefore  is still out on whether bajwa rsquo s three years in office will lead to a meaningful change in india pakistan relations or whether the general will be content to stick to the tried and tested path as far as his force is concerned
