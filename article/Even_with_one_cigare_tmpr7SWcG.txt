smokers who go through much less than a pack of cigarettes a day still have a higher risk of an early death than non smokers  a new study suggests

 quot there is no safe level of cigarette smoking  quot  said lead study author maki inoue choi  a researcher at the national cancer institute in rockville  maryland 
 quot even smokers who consistently smoked less than one cigarette per day were more likely to die in our study than never smokers  quot  inoue choi said by email 
tobacco smoking poses a major public health challenge and claims about five million lives each year worldwide  researchers note in jama internal medicine 
a growing number of smokers tend to be  quot light quot  smokers  going through less than half a pack of cigarettes a day  the authors write  this used to be how people cut back gradually on the path to quitting  but it s increasingly a pattern that smokers follow for years at a time 
to get a better picture of the health effects of light smoking  researchers tracked more than         adults aged    to     including more than        current smokers and more than         former smokers  who completed surveys in      and

by       compared to people who never smoked  adults who consistently smoked at least part of one cigarette a day were    percent more likely to have died of any cause  researchers report in jama internal medicine 
smoking one to    cigarettes a day was associated with    percent higher odds of dying from all causes during the study than not smoking at all 
lung cancer deaths in particular were much more likely among light smokers than non smokers  the odds of death from lung cancer were more than nine times higher with a habit of even one cigarette a day  while smoking up to    cigarettes a day was associated with almost    times the risk of death from lung cancer 
former smokers fared better when they quit at younger ages  for example  ex smokers of one to    cigarettes a day who kicked the habit after age    had a    percent higher risk of death from all causes during the study period  compared to those who kicked the habit at younger ages  one limitation of the study is that researchers relied on participants to accurately recall and report on how often they smoked even may years in the past  the authors note 
even so  the findings should reinforce that even light smokers can face serious health risks from the habit  the authors note 
 quot the take home message is that all smokers should stop smoking  even if they smoke only occasionally  or if they smoke very few cigarettes a day  quot  jean francois etter  a researcher at the university of geneva in switzerland who wasn t involved in the study  said in an email 
the study also showed very little benefit from cutting back from two packs a day to half a pack a day  said judith prochaska  a researcher at stanford university in california who wasn t involved in the study 
 quot low intensity smokers often downplay their use of tobacco   may even identify as nonsmokers   and may rationalize their behavior as low risk  quot  prochaska said by email 
 quot the findings ought to compel physicians to intervene with patients who report any level of current tobacco use  quot  prochaska added   quot as a motivating message  the sooner individuals quit smoking  the greater the health benefits in extending years of life  quot
