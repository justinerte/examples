from france rsquo s burkini furore to new york fashion week rsquo s first ever show featuring a hijab as part of every look  muslim fashion has captured western headlines this year  as modest fashion becomes arguably more mainstream than ever in many parts of europe and north america 
last weekend     year old halima aden caught the fashion world rsquo s attention when she became the first miss minnesota usa competitor to sport a hijab and a burkini during the pageant  the somali american teenager opted to stay covered for the competition rsquo s swimsuit category and kept her hair under wraps for all other rounds of the event  with the support of its organizers  reported local news channel kare     


this week she took to instagram to celebrate the milestone  with a message that included the statement   ldquo beauty isn rsquo t a one size fits all  we need to celebrate everyone and welcome those who are different than us  rdquo 


aden isn rsquo t the first woman to push this particular boundary  mdash  and it looks like the fashion industry might finally be taking note  following the widespread outrage following some french cities rsquo  creation of a short lived  lsquo burkini ban rsquo  this summer       has seen several proactive  lsquo modest fashion rsquo  moments 
indonesian designer anniesa hasibuan set the tone in september when her new york fashion week spring summer      catwalk show hit the headlines for exclusively featuring hijab clad models  dressed elegantly in trousers  tunics and long sleeved dresses  
then in november  muslim beauty blogger nura afia was unveiled as the star of cosmetic giant covergirl rsquo s latest commercial  the youtube sensation was recruited by the makeup brand  which has developed a reputation for championing diversity via its models and ambassadors  to front the campaign for its new  lsquo so lashy  blastpro rsquo  mascara  which launched on november    


 ldquo i rsquo m so excited to be a part of covergirl rsquo s new campaign  rdquo  afia said at the time   ldquo it feels so surreal  honestly  growing up and being insecure about wearing the hijab i never thought i would see muslim women represented on such a large scale  rdquo 
the strongest message came at the very beginning of       in january  when dolce  amp  gabbana announced plans to launch its  lsquo abaya collection rsquo   aimed at clients in the middle east  the collection featured the italian house rsquo s signature bold prints  alongside lace trimmed hemlines and a dash of jewelled embellishment  ensuring that the lightweight pieces radiate glamour while remaining conservative in structure
