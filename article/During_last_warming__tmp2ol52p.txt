during last warming period, antarctica heated up two to three times more than planet average
http://phys.org/news/2016-12-period-antarctica-planet-average.html
the disparity   antarctica warmed about    degrees celsius  nearly    degrees fahrenheit  between about        and        years ago  while the average temperature worldwide rose only about   degrees celsius  or   degrees fahrenheit   highlights the fact that the poles  both the arctic in the north and the antarctic in the south  amplify the effects of a changing climate  whether it gets warmer or cooler 
the calculations are in line with estimates from most climate models  proving that these models do a good job of estimating past climatic conditions and  very likely  future conditions in an era of climate change and global warming 
 the result is not a surprise  but if you look at the global climate models that have been used to analyze what the planet looked like        years ago   the same models used to predict global warming in the future   they are doing  on average  a very good job reproducing how cold it was in antarctica   said first author kurt cuffey  a glaciologist at the university of california  berkeley  and professor of geography and of earth and planetary sciences   that is noteworthy and a confirmation that we know how the system works  
these models currently predict that as a result of today s global climate change  antarctica will warm twice as much as the rest of the planet  though it won t reach its peak for a couple of hundred years  while the most likely climate change scenario  given business as usual greenhouse gas emissions  is a global average increase of   degrees celsius    degrees fahrenheit  by       the antarctic is predicted to warm eventually by around   degrees celsius     degrees fahrenheit  
the new results  which are the first good calculation of antarctica s ice age temperature and the amount of warming since  do rule out a couple of climate models that do not include enough feedback to accurately reproduce the amplified temperature in the polar regions  cuffey said 
cuffey and his colleagues  including gary clow of the u s  geological survey in lakewood  colorado  published their results online last week in the early edition of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences 
deglaciation in antarctica
the analysis is based on the fact that as the world warmed following the coldest part of the last ice age        years ago  the ice deep inside the antarctic glaciers warmed more slowly than earth s surface  just as a frozen turkey put into a hot oven will still be cold inside even after the surface has reached oven temperature  by measuring the remaining difference   the        year old ice deep in the west antarctic ice sheet is about   degree celsius cooler than the surface   the scientists were able to estimate the original temperature based on how fast pure ice warms up 
clow measured twice  once in      and again in       the temperature in a     kilometer deep    mile deep  borehole from which the west antarctic sheet divide ice core had been drilled during an eight year project that ended in       ice at the bottom of the borehole was deposited about        years ago  ice about one sixth of the way up about        years ago  and ice about one third of the way to the surface        years ago 
cuffey developed a technique to combine these temperature measurements  which are smoothed as a result of heat diffusion in the ice  with isotopic measurements of old ice to come up with an estimated temperature of      degrees  plus or minus     degrees celsius  warming since the depths of the ice age 
interestingly  the antarctic temperature increased much more rapidly than did arctic temperatures after the glacial maximum  by        years ago  antarctica had warmed to about    percent of its temperature today  the arctic took another             years to warm this much  primarily because of the fact that the northern hemisphere had huge ice sheets to buffer warming  and the fact that changes in ocean currents and earth s orbital configuration accelerated warming in the south 
antarctica was also more sensitive to global carbon dioxide levels  cuffey said  which increased as the global temperature increased because of changing ocean currents that caused upwelling of carbon dioxide rich waters from the depths of the ocean 
the waters surrounding antarctica may be one of the last places to experience human driven climate change  new research from the university of washington and the massachusetts institute of technology finds that ocean currents    
future global warming will not only depend on the amount of emissions from man made greenhouse gasses  but will also depend on the sensitivity of the climate system and response to feedback mechanisms  by reconstructing past    
scientists from the alfred wegener institute helmholtz centre for polar and marine research  awi  have overcome a seeming weakness of global climate models  they had previously not been able to simulate the extreme warm period    
parts of ancient antarctica were as warm as today s california coast  and polar regions of the southern pacific ocean registered   st century florida heat  according to scientists using a new way to measure past temperatures 
many factors related to warming will conspire to raise the planet s oceans over coming decades   thermal expansion of the world s oceans  melting of snow and ice worldwide  and the collapse of massive ice sheets 
even if carbon dioxide emissions came to a sudden halt  the carbon dioxide already in earth s atmosphere could continue to warm our planet for hundreds of years  according to princeton university led research published in    
at two miles long and five inches in diameter  the west antarctic ice sheet divide  wais  ice core is a tangible record of the last        years of our planet s climate 
alan wanamaker  working as a postdoctoral researcher from      to       was charged with beginning to compile a       year record of the marine climate for a spot in the north atlantic just off the fjords and fishing villages    
researchers with the university of texas at austin have found that incorporating snow data collected from space into computer climate models can significantly improve seasonal temperature predictions 
the way in which man made acids in the atmosphere interact with the dust that nourishes our oceans has been quantified by scientists for the first time 
the syrian civil war and subsequent refugee migration caused sudden changes in the area s land use and freshwater resources  according to satellite data analyzed by stanford researchers 
the effects of climate change will likely cause smaller but stronger storms in the united states  according to a new framework for modeling storm behavior developed at the university of chicago and argonne national laboratory
