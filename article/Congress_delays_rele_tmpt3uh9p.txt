apprehending rebellion  the congress has decided to delay by around a week the announcement of its first list of candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in punjab 
the party rsquo s central election committee  headed by congress president sonia gandhi  had in its december   meeting discussed the names of contenders of    seats and cleared       candidates  some members of the poll panel had raised objections to the nomination of the remaining six to seven candidates 
punjab congress president captain amarinder singh had told the hindustan times leadership summit on saturday that the first list of about    candidates out of the total     seats will be declared immediately after the party rsquo s election panel meeting 
however  congress sources said the list has been withheld on the request of the state leadership as it feared there could be rebellion by those denied party tickets   ldquo some of those left out could also leave the congress and join other parties  rdquo  a party functionary said 
a senior congress leader said the complete list could be announced anytime after the second meeting of the party rsquo s central election panel on december   
the sources said many  ldquo turncoats but winnable candidates rdquo  from the shiromani akali dal  sad   bjp  and the aam aadmi party  aap  are likely to be fielded from seats where the congress nominees are weak 
many sad  bjp and aap leaders have recently joined the congress after they were either denied re nomination or had fallen out of favour in their respective parties  the induction of former akali leaders sarwan singh phillaur  deepinder singh dhillon  harinder pal singh harry mann and inderbir singh bolaria has caused much resentment among the congress loyalists 
while phillaur was sacked by the akali dal as jails minister after the enforcement directorate  ed  summoned his son  mdash  and later the minister himself mdash  in a drugs case  dhillon is facing stiff opposition from certain congress quarters for his utterances against party vice president rahul gandhi  
dhillon had once reportedly questioned gandhi rsquo s ability to revive the sagging fortunes of the congress in punjab and claimed that wherever he went the party suffered irreparable setbacks
