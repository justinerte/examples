clemson quarterback deshaun watson is a heisman trophy finalist for the second consecutive season  joining louisville quarterback lamar jackson  michigan linebacker jabrill peppers and oklahoma teammates baker mayfield and dede westbrook 
the finalists were announced monday on espn and the award will be presented saturday in new york 
watson finished third in last year s voting  won by alabama running back derrick henry  just like last year  he heads to new york not as the favorite but as the contender coming on strong at the end  mayfield finished fourth last season  but did not get an invite to heisman presentation in new york 
peppers is the first defensive player to be a heisman finalists since notre dame linebacker manti teo was a distant runner up to johnny manziel in      
westbrook and mayfield are the first teammates to be finalists since reggie bush and matt leinart from southern california finished first and third  respectively in      
finalists are determined by the margins between vote getters  the ballots of more than     voters  which included former heisman winners  were due monday 
watson entered as the preseason favorite in what looked like a strong field of contenders  but jackson quickly swept past them all to be front runner  he was brilliant for the first two months of the season and louisville was looking like a college football playoff contender 
it seemed as if jackson would be a runaway heisman winner  but the   th ranked cardinals lost their final two games of the season  he was sacked    times in a lopsided loss at houston and he committed four turnovers in a last second loss against kentucky 
watson  meanwhile  has surged since clemson s only loss to pitt in mid november  he also had the benefit of playing in the atlantic coast conference title game last saturday and took full advantage of the spotlight  watson threw three touchdown passes and ran for two scores in a       victory against virginia tech to seal a spot in the college football playoff 
the raw numbers still favor jackson  who is second in the nation in total yards per game         and has accounted for    touchdowns     rushing tds and    td passes  with    turnovers  nine ints and four lost fumbles  in    games  watson averages       yards per game and has    touchdowns  six rushing and    passing  with    turnovers  all interceptions  in    games 
when the two met on oct    at clemson in what was one of the season s most entertaining games  watson threw for     yards and five touchdowns  ran for    and was picked off three times  jackson had     yards passing      rushing and accounted for three touchdowns with one interception  clemson won       
mayfield and westbrook have been a dynamic combination  and late in the season no    oklahoma started a dual campaign to promote both for the heisman  mayfield is on pace to break the ncaa record for passer efficiency rating in a season           westbrook has    catches for       yards and    touchdowns and has more receptions covering at least    yards      than any receiver in the country 
peppers played defense  offense and special teams for michigan  lining up all over the field
