geneva  the united nations appealed monday for a record       billion       billion euros  to provide aid in      to surging numbers of people hit by conflicts and disasters around the world 
it s  the highest amount we have ever requested   un humanitarian aid chief stephen o brien told a press conference 
 this is the reflection of a state of human needs in the world not witnessed since the second world war   he said 
he added that more than    percent of the needs stem from man made conflicts  many of which are now protracted and push up demand for relief year after year  
the global appeal by un agencies and other humanitarian organisations aims to gather funds to help the      million most vulnerable of the nearly     million people expected to require assistance across    countries next year 
the numbers are staggering  especially when considering that three war ravaged countries     syria  yemen and afghanistan     alone account for about a third of all of those in need 
the amount appealed for tops the       billion requested last december for          a year when  humanitarian actors have saved  protected and supported more people than in any previous year since the founding of the united nations   o brien said in the report 
in the end  the un broadened its      appeal to       billion  but donors coughed up just       billion for aid projects this year 
 more frequent  more severe 
 with persistently escalating humanitarian needs  the gap between what has to be done to save and protect more people today and what humanitarians are financed to do and can access is growing ever wider   o brien said in the report 
making matters worse  he said that  with climate change  natural disasters are likely to become more frequent  more severe  
aid needs have been rising steadily for decades  when the un launched its first global appeal    years ago  it estimated that just      billion would cover aid needs around the globe in      
but the situation has worsened dramatically in the last few years 
globally   humanitarian needs continue to rise and humanitarian efforts are hampered by reduced access  growing disrespect for human rights and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law   o brien said 
the report highlighted  severely constrained  humanitarian access in places like syria  yemen  iraq and south sudan  which is  leaving affected people without basic services and protection  
 mines  explosives  remnants of war and improvised explosive devices impede humanitarian access and threaten the lives of vulnerable populations in conflict affected regions   it said 
the syrian conflict  which has killed more than         people since march      and forced more than half the population to flee  is set to absorb the biggest portion of the funds 
the un wants a full      billion to go to helping those inside syria  with another      billion destined for refugees and their host communities in the region 
second in line is south sudan  which has been wracked by civil war since      and where the un has warned  ethnic cleansing  is taking place 
the un plan is to spend a total of      billion to help south sudanese in need  including      billion for refugees from the country 
and      billion should go to help the victims of yemen s brutal civil war  which has escalated dramatically since a saudi led coalition intervened in march
