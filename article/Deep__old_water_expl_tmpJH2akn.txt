deep, old water explains why antarctic ocean hasn't warmed
http://phys.org/news/2016-05-deep-antarctic-ocean-hasnt.html
the study resolves a scientific conundrum  and an inconsistent pattern of warming often seized on by climate deniers  observations and climate models show that the unique currents around antarctica continually pull deep  centuries old water up to the surface   seawater that last touched earth s atmosphere before the machine age  and has never experienced fossil fuel related climate change  the paper is published may    in nature geoscience 
 with rising carbon dioxide you would expect more warming at both poles  but we only see it at one of the poles  so something else must be going on   said lead author kyle armour  a uw assistant professor of oceanography and of atmospheric sciences   we show that it s for really simple reasons  and ocean currents are the hero here  
gale force westerly winds that constantly whip around antarctica act to push surface water north  continually drawing up water from below  the southern ocean s water comes from such great depths  and from sources that are so distant  that it will take centuries before the water reaching the surface has experienced modern global warming 
other places in the oceans  like the west coast of the americas and the equator  draw seawater up from a few hundred meters depth  but that doesn t have the same effect 
 the southern ocean is unique because it s bringing water up from several thousand meters  as much as   miles    armour said   it s really deep  old water that s coming up to the surface  all around the continent  you have a lot of water coming to the surface  and that water hasn t seen the atmosphere for hundreds of years  
the water surfacing off antarctica last saw earth s atmosphere centuries ago in the north atlantic  then sank and followed circuitous paths through the world s oceans before resurfacing off antarctica  hundreds or even a thousand years later 
delayed warming of the antarctic ocean is commonly seen in global climate models  but the culprit had been wrongly identified as churning  frigid seas mixing extra heat downward  the study used data from argo observational floats and other instruments to trace the path of the missing heat 
 the old idea was that heat taken up at the surface would just mix downward  and that s the reason for the slow warming   armour said   but the observations show that heat is actually being carried away from antarctica  northward along the surface  
in the atlantic  the northward flow of the ocean s surface continues all the way to the arctic  the study used dyes in model simulations to show that seawater that has experienced the most climate change tends to clump up around the north pole  this is another reason why the arctic s ocean and sea ice are bearing the brunt of global warming  while antarctica is largely oblivious 
 the oceans are acting to enhance warming in the arctic while damping warming around antarctica   armour said   you can t directly compare warming at the poles  because it s occurring on top of very different ocean circulations  
knowing where the extra heat trapped by greenhouse gases goes  and identifying why the poles are warming at different rates  will help to better predict temperatures in the future 
new research published in scientific reports in february indicates that a warm ocean surface water prevailed during the last ice age  sandwiched between two major ice sheets just south of greenland 
over recent decades  scientists have watched a climate conundrum develop at the opposite ends of earth  the arctic has warmed and steadily lost sea ice  whereas antarctica has cooled in many places and may even be gaining    
many factors related to warming will conspire to raise the planet s oceans over coming decades   thermal expansion of the world s oceans  melting of snow and ice worldwide  and the collapse of massive ice sheets 
to investigate why the global warming trend varies from decade to decade  scientists from the national oceanography centre  noc  will work alongside those from nine other research organisations as part of a major new multidisciplinary    
the arctic ice cap is melting faster than ever before  threatening to push so much fresh water into the north atlantic that it could disrupt how the ocean regulates global temperatures  a prominent oceanographer has warned 
influence of sea ice loss on arctic warming is shaped by varying temperatures in the pacific ocean  new study shows
at two miles long and five inches in diameter  the west antarctic ice sheet divide  wais  ice core is a tangible record of the last        years of our planet s climate 
alan wanamaker  working as a postdoctoral researcher from      to       was charged with beginning to compile a       year record of the marine climate for a spot in the north atlantic just off the fjords and fishing villages    
researchers with the university of texas at austin have found that incorporating snow data collected from space into computer climate models can significantly improve seasonal temperature predictions 
the way in which man made acids in the atmosphere interact with the dust that nourishes our oceans has been quantified by scientists for the first time 
the syrian civil war and subsequent refugee migration caused sudden changes in the area s land use and freshwater resources  according to satellite data analyzed by stanford researchers 
the effects of climate change will likely cause smaller but stronger storms in the united states  according to a new framework for modeling storm behavior developed at the university of chicago and argonne national laboratory
