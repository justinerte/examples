eating    gm of nuts  mdash  about a small handful  mdash  a day lowers the risk of heart disease  cancer and early death  concluded a large analysis of current research 
an analysis of     published studies involving close to          people around the world showed eating a handful of tree  mdash  and groundnuts cut people rsquo s risk of heart disease by nearly    percent  their risk of cancer by    percent  and their risk of premature death by    percent 

eating nuts also halved the risk of dying from respiratory illnesses by about a half and diabetes by nearly    percent  but there is less data on these diseases in relation to nut consumption  said researchers from imperial college london and the norwegian university of science and technology  who published the study in the journal bmc medicine 
while there was small variations between men and women  people living in different regions  or people with different risk factors  there was an overall reduction in disease risk across most of them 
the study involved tree nuts such as almonds  walnuts and hazelnuts and groundnuts such as peanuts  even though nuts are quite high in fat  their high fibre and protein content lowers risk of obesity over time 


 ldquo we found a consistent reduction in risk across many different diseases  which is a strong indication that there is a real underlying relationship between nut consumption and different health outcomes  it rsquo s quite a substantial effect for such a small amount of food  rdquo  said study co author dagfinn aune from the school of public health at imperial 
what makes nuts beneficial is their high nutritional value   ldquo nuts and peanuts are high in fibre  magnesium  and polyunsaturated fats   nutrients that are beneficial for cutting cardiovascular disease risk and which can reduce cholesterol levels  rdquo  said aune   ldquo some nuts  particularly walnuts and pecan nuts are also high in antioxidants  which can fight oxidative stress and possibly reduce cancer risk  rdquo
