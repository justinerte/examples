president elect donald trump nbsp said monday he has chosen retired johns hopkins neurosurgeon and political rival ben carson to serve as the secretary of the department of housing and urban development 
if confirmed by the senate  carson would oversee more than       employees  a nearly     billion budget and national policies that affect millions of families who live in public housing or receive rental assistance from the federal government 
 quot ben carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities  quot  trump said in a statement   quot we have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival  very much including our inner cities  quot 
carson  who has no experience in government or with federal housing policy  has received push back nbsp from trump s critics    some of whom were surprised the incoming nbsp administration chose not to select carson for a job involving medicine  nbsp 
 quot dr  ben carson is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as housing and urban development  quot  house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement   quot our country deserves a hud secretary with the relevant experience  quot 
carson  a trailblazing pediatric neurosurgeon and former baltimore county resident  burst onto the political scene in      with a speech at the annual national prayer breakfast in washington  carson  who is     suspended his own presidential campaign in march 
though he was a vocal surrogate for trump during the general election campaign  carson initially played down discussion of serving in his administration  in november a close aide noted that carson had no experience and that  quot the last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency  quot 
carson will face a number of important decisions at hud  several advocates have focused on his previous comments opposing federal fair housing regulations approved by the obama administration nbsp last year  those rules require cities like baltimore to create plans to reduce segregation  nbsp

but low income housing advocates are also concerned about the agency s budget  the incoming president has vowed to trim nbsp non defense spending across the board  at hud that could mean a reduction in development grants used by cities or rental vouchers used by roughly   million people 
on the other hand  throughout the presidential campaign  trump spoke repeatedly of revitalizing cities  he frequently promised to  quot turn our inner cities around quot  and  quot bring jobs back  quot 
he offered no specifics for how he would accomplish those goals  nbsp 
 quot it s devastating what s happening to our inner cities  quot  trump said during a debate in october   quot what do you have to lose  it can t get any worse  quot  nbsp
