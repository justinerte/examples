 trenton  ontario     a team of dinosaur specialists from the smithsonian   s national museum of natural history drove down a tree lined road outside toronto  past a carquest auto parts store and up to a gray  aluminum sided building that held a spectacle     million years in the making  
then they stepped inside and finally saw it  the    nation   s t  rex    standing upright for the first time since the cretaceous period 
one of them gasped  arms crossed  another quietly circled the    foot tall     foot long skeleton  a third     the one who almost always has something to say     could say nothing at all 
   a rare moment     dinosaur curator matthew carrano recalled that afternoon     when i   m not talking    
in what may be among the most dramatic fossil displays on earth  the beast was posed looming over the fiberglass body of a triceratops collapsed on its side  with one foot crushing into the horned herbivore   s ribs  the tyrannosaurus rex   s head     which is the size of a riding lawn mower     was bent down  appearing as if a moment away from decapitating its prey 
discovered in montana in       the dinosaur had been exhibited in pieces until last year  when the smithsonian institution took possession of the coveted fossil on a    year loan from its owner  the army corps of engineers  
last fall  the animal   s bones were shipped to ontario   s research casting international  a renowned firm of experts that has assembled dinosaurs for museums all over the world 
the smithsonian team had imagined the ambitious presentation two years ago  first through carrano   s hand gestures  then in pencil on sheets of paper  then on computer screens  then in a miniature   d model  but none of that would matter if the real life display didn   t work 
for one of the world   s most visited museums  the stakes couldn   t be much higher  the dinosaur has been given the grandiose title of the    nation   s t  rex     after all  and it will serve as the gem of the natural history museum   s fossil hall when the space reopens in      after a      million renovation 
one day  the team knew  this t  rex may become the most viewed in history 
the blowtorch hissed as its blue flame licked a blackened section of the t  rex   s steel tail 
with his colleague applying the heat  garth dallman stood on a nearby ladder and stared through clear safety glasses at the glowing metal  on the back of his tan t shirt was the cartoon image of a blowtorch wielding human skeleton riding the back of a t  rex skeleton 
dallman and others from the casting company had worked through the weekend  adding to the more than       man hours they had spent on this project in preparation for monday   s big unveiling  they had attached the t  rex   s rib stomping foot just moments before the smithsonian team arrived  and by afternoon  dallman looked very much like a man who needed a nap  his black circled eyes were bloodshot  and behind his ear was a pencil with an eraser rubbed down to the metal casing 
but rest would have to wait  because on tuesday they were raising the tail five inches  the museum wanted to be sure that its lowest point hung at least    feet off the ground  to prevent visitors from reaching high enough to damage it 
but no alteration could make the t  rex   s pose unrealistic  using a green laser pointer  carrano explained that the back tip shouldn   t be raised higher than the base 
   gravity     he said 
the casting crew arrived at    a m  tuesday to heat a section of the steel to       degrees and shift it up  that process caused one of the bolts that support a vertebrae to seize up 
   are they all stuck  or just that one     said matt fair  a    year veteran of the company and its production manager 
   just that one     dallman told him 
with the aid of an angle grinder and a drill  a new bolt was soon installed  and dallman was on to the next challenge 
the dinosaur is one of the most complete t  rex skeletons ever unearthed  with more than      original pieces  but that still required the casting firm to fabricate    others  including the head  because the real one is too fragile to exhibit  they   re all held together by more than       feet of steel that pushes the total weight beyond       pounds 
the company is being paid     million to assemble    smithsonian specimens over the next four years   the t  rex and other fossils will eventually be dismantled  shipped back to washington and reassembled at the natural history museum  
at first glance  the rci crew members don   t seem like the kind of people who stitch together ancient and delicate bones for the world   s most prestigious museums  voices subdued and personalities mellow  they wear boots and jeans and flannel  with hands coated in black  they work beneath a clock that instead of numbers lists letters that spell    guinness time    
their even keels and mild senses of humor are  in many ways  ideal for this line of work  which has no room for people who succumb to pressure handling priceless pieces of natural history 
each crew member must be part construction worker  part sculptor  part scientist  part mechanic  part anthropologist and part engineer 
dallman  a gray bearded master blacksmith with a background in museums  designed more than     unique mounts  known as armatures  that attach to the frame and hold the bones in place using thin  metal tentacles meant to integrate with the dinosaur   s form  many are so elegant that they wouldn   t look out of place on display at washington   s national gallery of art 
fair  who also tends a farm of chickens and goats  built a    foot gantry crane this summer with the help of his sons  his yellow behemoth was used to hoist the t  rex   s       pound hip into place 
   you can   t buy one that big     said fair  who spent so much time prepping fossils in washington for shipment to canada that he still has a giant grocery store card on his key chain 
peter may  the business   s owner  studied sculpting in college and fell into the field after responding to a museum   s newspaper ad  he founded the company in      and has grown it into a firm of    employees who work with clients as far away as germany  japan and australia 
for may      his day job stopped feeling surreal long ago  but few things give him more pleasure than when a stranger asks what he does for a living  he grins through his salt and pepper goatee and says  simply     i build dinosaurs    
steve jabo cut a slab of cardboard with a box cutter  then used duct tape to attach his tracing of what looked like a crocodile skeleton 
   it   s very low tech     said jabo  a smithsonian fossil preparator  he and his colleagues had come to canada not just to gawk at their prized monster  but also to determine precisely how the t  rex  and everything around it  should appear 
jabo brought the champsosaurus model and two other small cutouts to museum project manager siobhan starrs and pauline dolovich  a toronto based designer who is helping to plan the layout 
   where   s champsy going to go     jabo said 
starrs and dolovich needed a minute  the pair had spent much of the prior    hours consulting a book of designs thicker than a dictionary 
   this is two volumes     dolovich said later     of nine    
most buildings are designed by the foot  but not the fossil hall  it   s being designed by the inch  which means that      million presentation decisions have to be made     and that   s counting only the floor space 
in the district three weeks earlier  museum director kirk johnson stood in the empty hall and detailed its future  his voice echoing through an expanse that felt far more like a tomb than it ever had when it was filled with dead animals  lights flickered  yellow caution tape hung from columns and sections of walls were gashed  as if an actual t  rex had chomped into them 
like clearing plaque from an artery  the museum   s staffers will dismantle decades of incremental additions and clutter  many of the       now removed specimens also won   t be brought back as the space     once dubbed the hall of extinct monsters     returns to its      design  a much more open layout that will be partly lit by sunshine 
though the museum   s attendance is only slightly behind last year   s pace of      million visitors  johnson had once hoped that the renovation wouldn   t require five years  he now knows that it will take every bit of it  and  in canada  the museum   s team seemed acutely aware of the time crunch 
they settled on a spot for the champsosaurus and its companions  they discussed how to depict the triceratops cast  deciding that its frill could have puncture wounds but no claw marks  because carrano had never seen such a wound on an actual fossil  they debated how high they should place the tail of what will be the t  rex   s neighbor  an edmontosaurus that the cast company   s technicians had found was covered  in part  by a      copy of the washington post     buy a home in washington   s most popular residence section  columbia heights     an ad urged  
they asked fair if he knew what the current plan suggested for the edmontosaurus 
   i would guess it   s about   or   feet  eh     he said  adding a touch of canadian to his answer 
and as the afternoon waned  and the museum team   s flight back to d c  approached  starrs sat cross legged on the floor  jotting down notes with her back to the smithsonian   s most important dinosaur 
she paused and looked up 
   it gives me goose bumps  literally  to think about how many children and their children and grandchildren will remember the moment     she said  pointing over her shoulder     and the moment is in front of the t  rex    
then starrs stood  brushed the brown dirt off of her jeans and got back to work  because      isn   t as far away as it sounds
