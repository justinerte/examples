you re never too old to reap the health benefits of quitting smoking  a new study finds 
 quot even participants who quit smoking as recently as in their   s were    percent less likely to die during follow up than those who continued to smoke into their   s  quot  said lead researcher sarah nash  who conducted the study while at the u s  national cancer institute 
in addition  the age at which you start smoking can have an impact on longevity  the researchers found

 quot this study confirms that age at smoking initiation and cessation  both key components of smoking duration  continue to be important predictors of mortality in u s  adults over age     quot  nash said 
 quot it also underscores the importance of measures to prevent initiation  as well as encourage cessation  for all smokers  quot  she added  nash is currently with the alaska native epidemiology center at the alaska native tribal health consortium in anchorage 
nash s team found that smoking  which is known to be an important predictor of early death among middle aged smokers  was also strongly related to early death from smoking related causes among those age    and older 
compared with those who had never smoked  people who still smoked when they were    and older were three times more likely to die during the six year study period  nash said 
in addition  among current smokers  the age at which they started smoking was linked to an increased risk of smoking related death  nash said   quot smokers who started smoking earlier in life were at increased risk of death  as were those who smoked more cigarettes per day over the age of     quot  she said 
 quot regardless of their age  all smokers benefit from quitting  quot  nash added   quot also  smoking patterns early in life may still affect mortality even    to    years later  so  it is important to support efforts to prevent adolescent smoking initiation  quot 
the study findings were published in late november in the american journal of preventive medicine 
the study reinforces several well known facts about smoking and the risk of death  said dr  norman edelman  a senior medical consultant to the american lung association 
continuing smoking increases the risk of dying  because the risks of cancer  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd  and heart disease continue to increase as you keep smoking  he said 
 quot but the study also makes the point that i try to tell my patients  some of whom believe it and some of whom don t  that smoking cessation is good for you even late in life  if you stop  you will live longer than if you don t stop  quot  edelman said 
for the study  nash and her colleagues collected data on more than         men and women  age    and older  who took part in a national health study  the participants completed a questionnaire about their smoking habits in            deaths among the participants were tracked until the end of      
between      and       the researchers correlated age at death with the age when the participants started or stopped smoking 
causes of death were also noted  including lung cancer and other smoking related cancers  such as bladder  colon  esophageal  head and neck  kidney and renal pelvis  liver  pancreatic and stomach cancers and acute myeloid leukemia   also assessed were deaths from heart disease  stroke  diabetes and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia  influenza and copd 
the researchers also took age  gender  level of education and alcohol use into account 
at the start of the study  the average age of participants was     nearly    percent were former smokers  and   percent were current smokers  men were less likely     percent  to have never smoked than women     percent   men smoked more than women  and men were more likely than women to have started smoking at age        percent vs     percent  
over an average follow up of six years  nearly    percent of the participants died  among those who died     percent had never smoked  death rates increased among those who quit smoking at later ages     percent for those who quit in their   s     percent if they quit in their   s     percent for those in their   s  and    percent for those in their   s  nash s team found 
current smokers fared worst of all  with    percent dying  nash said  death rates for women were lower than men at each age  she added 
edelman said   quot this study makes it clear that you can t hide behind the usual smoke screen  that   the damage has already been done  i may as well continue smoking   if you quit smoking  you will add years to your life  quot
