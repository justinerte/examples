sports programming generates     billion a year in revenue for tv companies  according to barclay   s capital  with the nfl alone collecting nearly      billion 
last year  americans collectively spent    billion hours watching sports on tv          nbsp a nbsp     increase from a decade ago  nbsp 
they watched nbsp football  baseball  basketball  nbsp hockey  horse racing  nascar  rowing  rugby  soccer and volleyball         even nbsp little league championships and poker games 
       live sports is the most valuable content on the planet         said adam ware  head of digital media at tennis channel  based in santa monica 
pay tv distributors like directv and charter communications have written bigger and bigger checks for the rights to carry nbsp sports channels         nbsp fortifying nbsp a business model in which cable and satellite tv subscribers  and nbsp advertisers  underwrite the costs 
sports nbsp have become the glue holding the pay tv bundle together  while internet nbsp streaming options including nbsp netflix  hulu and amazon com offer thousands of hours nbsp of scripted shows  there is nbsp little in the way of live sports  so nbsp sports fans remain tethered to their cable bundle 
but heading into       it could nbsp be nbsp a new ball game  the cable business model that sports channels helped build is under siege  pay tv companies are balking at paying higher rights fees  fueling the kind of standoff that has kept thousands of fans from watching the los angeles dodgers        channel 
pay tv penetration nbsp peaked in       and declines in the number of households that subscribe to a satellite or cable tv service have accelerated  since       basic cable channels  including espn  tnt and discovery  have lost more than   nbsp million nbsp subscribers  nbsp 
consumers are weary of nbsp never ending increases in their monthly pay tv bills  which have been partly fueled by rising sports costs  and unlike years ago  they have cheaper online alternatives 
       every year  there are more entertainment options for people to fill their leisure time         said dennis deninger  a former espn production executive who now teaches sports communications at syracuse university 
nonetheless  sports channels retain considerable leverage  sports programming generates     billion a year in revenue for tv companies  according to barclay       s capital  big games nbsp grab the highest ratings  last month  fox broadcasting scored    million viewers for the final world series game   nbsp and fans tend to watch sports programs live  nbsp rather than fast forwarding through the ads  which allows networks to charge a premium for the commercial time 
       teams have rabid fan bases  and they have nbsp generations of loyal fans         ware said         these are nbsp all the ingredients that make for hit tv         nbsp 
broadcast and cable tv executives teed up more than         hours of sports programming last year  according to nbsp audience measurement firm nielsen  that nbsp represents a      increase compared with      
the major beneficiaries have been sports leagues and teams  which are expected to nbsp rake in nbsp an estimated       billion in media rights fees next year from tv  radio and internet outlets  according to a recent pwc report on sports 
the nfl alone collects nearly nbsp      nbsp billion a year from media companies  including nearly nbsp      billion a year from walt disney co        s espn for        monday night football        and other football extras  nbsp the nfl reaps      billion a year from nbsp directv for its sunday ticket package and nbsp roughly nbsp      nbsp billion a year from nbc  cbs and fox 
that       s a long way from the nbsp first national tv sports contract  which was nbsp struck in      between the abc network and the american football league 
that year  abc agreed to pay      million over five years to televise weekly games and championships  said deninger  who wrote  quot sports on television  the how and why behind what you see  quot  nbsp the rival nfl then        saw the wisdom of doing a national television contract to replace the    regional television deals nbsp that each of the nfl owners had         he said 
a lucrative business model was born  nbsp but the game changer was rupert murdoch       s nbsp upstart fox broadcasting       s gambit in      for nbsp television rights for sunday afternoon nfl games  though tv nbsp broadcasters were losing money on the nbsp nfl  the network behind        the simpsons        and        married with children        was desperate for credibility and a program that could bolster its tv stations  nbsp fox bid a staggering      million a year              million more than cbs had offered 
       that       s nbsp when nbsp the rights fees nbsp started to soar into the stratosphere         deninger said  nbsp 
having football put fox on the map  affiliate tv stations flipped their alliances to fox  a few nbsp years later  when the rights package was up again  cbs swallowed another huge increase  dislodging nbc  and the race was on  nbsp 
now  fox pays      billion nbsp a year for pro football  and cbs pays      billion for its sunday afternoon and thursday night games  nbc       s total is nearly      billion  the broadcast networks are demanding higher fees from pay tv operators to carry their station signals  in part  to help cover their football costs 
the rising cost of sports is a major reason for the higher cable bills  sports now make up about     of programming costs paid by cable and satellite tv operators  for example  espn costs an average       nbsp a month  per subscriber home  and a channel like sportsnet la has been nbsp offered for about       a month  per subscriber home  according to consulting firm snl kagan  the nfl network costs pay tv companies nbsp       a month per subscriber         nearly twice the fee of such popular channels as nickelodeon or cnn 
snl kagan estimates that pay tv customers nbsp next year will chip in an average nbsp        nbsp a month for sports  up from       a month in       and in nbsp los angeles  the amount is even higher             to     nbsp a month         because la nbsp has more sports networks than other cities 
what       s behind the soaring costs  one contributor is the proliferation of regional sports channels  in       snl kagan tracked    regional sports networks around the country but  by last year  the roster had swelled to nbsp     the net effect is that consumers are paying substantially more to watch many of the nbsp same teams 
       you have the same amount of sports rights as you did before         nbsp  said adam gajo  sports nbsp analyst with snl kagan  nbsp        it       s really the number of networks entering cable packages that are making the costs go up  nbsp it       s five networks now  not just two  nbsp and the new networks debuted at higher price points        
the land grab for nbsp sports channels began accelerating nbsp a decade ago  nbsp existing nbsp tv rights deals were expiring and pay tv distributors including time warner cable  comcast and directv wanted in they had been watching as teams  such as nbsp the new york yankees  were pulling in sizable audiences with their own channels 
more sports channels seemed like a sure bet 
the nbsp logic paid off for spectrum sportsnet  the four year old cable network that televises los angeles lakers games  time warner cable nabbed the rights to the lakers in      after a fierce bidding war  fox sports also was in the hunt nbsp but time warner cable offered more  a    billion     year deal with the lakers  that represented a      increase in fees over what fox sports nbsp had been paying for lakers games 
next up to bat was the dodgers  the new owner of the team  guggenheim baseball management  wanted its own channel  fox again was in the running  but time warner cable in      clinched the deal by agreeing to pay the dodgers       billion over    years  nbsp         a        increase in fees  according to one estimate 
the nbsp dodgers channel  sportsnet la  launched nbsp in      but quickly sputtered  nbsp the dispute between directv  cox communications and others and time warner cable attracted the attention of federal prosecutors  last month  the u s  department of justice sued directv  now owned by at amp t  alleging that it colluded with other distributors to nbsp block the channel       s distribution 
sportsnet la isn       t the only nbsp channel lobbying for greater distribution  nbsp the nbsp pac    tv networks  which nbsp include a local channel that features nbsp ucla and usc games  won nbsp carriage on all of the major systems          nbsp spectrum  nbsp at amp t u verse  nbsp cox communications and dish networks         except for directv 
skirmishes have broken out in other areas  nbsp a regional sports channel in houston that carried astros and rockets games  previously backed by cable giant comcast corp   filed for nbsp bankruptcy two years ago after other pay tv distributors refused to carry it because of its nbsp price  nbsp at amp t and directv then bought the channel out of bankruptcy court 
and early this year  comcast dropped the yankees channel  yes  which is nbsp most expensive regional sports channel in the nation  nbsp comcast complained that only a fraction of customers that nbsp it serves in northern new jersey and connecticut were watching yes 
there are other signs of strain  the nfl is grappling with falling ratings this year  the audience decline has prompted some to wonder whether the nfl has tried to slice the product too finely  nbsp but most analysts expect the nfl will fetch a lofty sum for the mobile phone streaming rights when the current pact with verizon expires in      
       history is going to repeat itself  it used to be that nbsp sports were on broadcast tv channels  then cable channels found a nice business         said nbsp ware of the tennis channel  nbsp        and now you will see sports moving nbsp to digital platforms          nbsp 
last week  cbs scored a big win by clinching digital streaming rights for nfl games  nbsp the network had been angling for more than two years for permission to stream the games that air on cbs to subscribers of its       a month digital all access service  but the league had been holding back  instead flirting with new media players yahoo and twitter 
the nfl ultimately granted the coveted rights to its    year broadcast partner at a time when tech giants have been sniffing around  retail giant amazon com  which operates the prime video streaming service  is on the hunt for rights from channels and niche sporting leagues in an effort to create a sports channel package that it could sell  nbsp 
espn is spending nearly    billion for a minority stake in the streaming company bamtech  which has the technology to deliver high quality video streams  espn is expected to join tennis channel  cbs and several sports leagues  including major league baseball  in marketing its product directly to consumers 
such digital offerings could be alluring to sports fans because they already have an affinity for their favorite teams and channels  digital media also can be personalized to build stronger relationships  keeping customers on their phones and tablets longer 
       you don       t have to be a broadcast network anymore         deninger said         if you have money  and a way to distribute nbsp programming  then you too can be a player  and that       s what the leagues want         nbsp more players because that means even higher fees
