imagine not being able to afford one of life s great pleasures   sex 
that s true for many older couples  doctors say  soaring prices for prescription medicines for impotence and other problems have put the remedies out of reach for some 
without insurance coverage  viagra and cialis cost about     a pill  triple their      list prices  the new  quot female viagra  quot  a daily pill for low sex drive called addyi  costs      per month  older products for women also have seen huge price run ups  truven health analytics data show 
 quot many of them don t get past the pharmacy counter once they see the price  quot  says sheryl kingsberg  a university hospitals cleveland medical center behavioral psychologist and researcher who counsels men and women 
what people actually pay out of pocket varies  some insurance prescription plans  including medicare  cover some of the medicines  some plans don t cover any  arguing they re not medically necessary  many require steep copayments or limit the number of impotence pills per prescription 
 quot once you get to a certain price point  sex becomes a financial decision  quot  says dr  elizabeth kavaler  a sexual dysfunction specialist at new york s lenox hill hospital   quot it takes a lot of the joy out of this  quot 
five of six specialists interviewed by the associated press say patients have told them they ve given up sex because of the cost 
now  a little relief is coming  late next year  viagra and cialis will get at least one generic competitor costing slightly less  prices will plunge later when more generics reach the market  for women  an addyi rival is in late stage testing  a few other products now have generic versions  and other options are in development 
a generation ago  long married couples accepted their sex lives trailing off with age  kavaler says  key hormone levels drop with age  reducing sex drive and causing problems such as impotence and vaginal dryness  which often makes intercourse painful 
today  midlife divorce is more common  divorced or widowed men and women often seek new partners  and sex becomes important again  meanwhile  they re bombarded by ads for impotence remedies and other treatments 
 quot couples in their   s    s and   s are more sexual than they ve ever been  quot  says kavaler 
until pfizer launched the first impotence pill  viagra  in       there were few options for men besides penile implants and injections  viagra and cialis each quickly topped    billion in global annual sales  and products for women s symptoms eventually followed  however  price hikes appear to be limiting usage for some products in the u s   where prices aren t regulated 
since       the number of viagra prescriptions filled in the u s  has fallen    percent to about   million a year  meanwhile  prescriptions for cialis  which now has a popular daily pill option  have gone up slightly  according to health data firm quintilesims 
popular women s estrogen products such as vagifem vaginal tablets and estrace cream also have seen prescriptions decline in recent years  addyi  only on the market for a year  has had dismal sales 
dr  lauren streicher offers women four treatment options  and most pick vagifem  a month s supply costs      and insurance coverage is limited  a generic version  yuvafem  just launched at a slightly cheaper price 
 quot they go to their pharmacy and see how much it costs  and then they call me up and say   i can t do it   quot  says streicher  director of the center for sexual medicine and menopause at northwestern university s medical school in chicago 
but not being able to have sex  quot is a deal breaker in a lot of relationships  quot  she adds 
the drugs  makers insist list prices far exceed the negotiated prices insurers pay them and say they price products based on their value  according to the companies  nearly all their customers are insured  pfizer says most insured viagra users pay    to    per pill  for instance 
patients unwilling to forego sex  doctors say  split pills or otherwise ration medicines  beg for scarce samples or seek copay discount coupons  men with enlarged prostates can request cialis because it s also approved for that condition  usually with insurance coverage  some women make do with over the counter lubricants 
many shop for price  which can vary widely by pharmacy 
others take a big risk  buying  quot herbal viagra quot  at gas stations or ordering viagra online from  quot canadian pharmacies quot  that likely sell counterfeit drugs made in poor countries  says dr  irwin goldstein  director of san diego sexual medicine 
some doctors have gotten inventive 
dr  nachum katlowitz  head of urology at new york s staten island university hospital  offers an alternative costing about    per pill at some pharmacies  the active ingredient in viagra  sildenafil   is also in pfizer s now generic blood pressure pill revatio but at one fifth the dose 
one of his patients  a    year old hospital technician  takes several of the blood pressure pills before sex 
 quot i couldn t afford it if i had to pay for viagra  quot  says robert  who asked that his last name not be used to protect his privacy 
he s experienced modest improvements and says he and his wife of    years now enjoy sex twice as often
