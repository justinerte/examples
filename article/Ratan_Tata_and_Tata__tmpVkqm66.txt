the words and news leaks are flying back and forth between bombay house  the godly abode of the pre eminent tata group  and the other party  known more humbly as the mistry camp  this might be a battle between david and goliath  if the might of the tatas is pitted against the very rich  but in a political way much humbler cyrus mistry  but it is becoming increasingly clear that the deposed chairman of tata sons has several cards up his sleeve that go beyond the minority    percent he controls in the closely held flagship of the tata empire in which the tata trusts led by ratan tata  between them control more than    percent 
the scene is in many ways reminiscent of the indian national congress  which split vertically exactly    years ago to this month  on    november        indira gandhi was expelled from the party even as she led the nation as prime minister on the grounds that she violated party discipline when she fielded v v giri as the presidential candidate and called for a  conscience vote  that ousted the official party candidate  neelam sanjeeva reddy 
tata sons has ousted cyrus mistry in what it considered the interests of tata  values  in a resemblance to mrs  gandhi s expulsion  the battles now shift to each tata led company in which mistry continues to be chairman 
now the big questions  does the congress party exist for the people of india or does it exist for the rules and regulations of the party  does tata sons exist for the upkeep of the tata values as defined by the parsi community trusts or does it exist as the custodian of the shareholders of the publicly held and some other companies under its management and supervision 
in that autumn of       indira gandhi was pitted against giants such as s k   patil  morarji desai  s nijalingappa and k kamaraj  the opponents of mrs  gandhi  known then as the  syndicate  were against the woman who was until then known as the goongi gudiya  silent doll   it turns out indira s group called congress  requisition     eventually got the backing of     of the     votes in the all india congress committee and ended up later as the  real  congress  the indian national congress under indira also got    percent of the national votes in the next general election held in       taking     of the     lok sabha seats  the old stalwarts got less than fourth of that 
can mistry now pull off an indira style revolution  this may not be easy because analogies cannot be stretched too much  mistry s big bet is for shareholder democracy in group companies in which tata sons does not have the same hold that tata trusts have over tata sons itself 
also seecyrus says tata group nobody s fiefdom  tatas say mistry made it his  battle escalates
with some independent directors including respected figures like deepak parekh coming out in favour of mistry  the field is wide open  the battles may differ from company to company  from all indications  ratan tata will try his political clout to sway public sector financial institutions such as the life insurance corporation to vote in favour of his strategy   remember  tata nano  whose investment is at the heart of mistry s tussle with bombay house giants  is being manufactured in the prime minister s home state  gujarat  
between the financial institutions and minority shareholders  a lot will be said and done  every tata company has a unique shareholding structure and numbers will be counted in each with its unique balance of power 
it is clear  however  that three hard questions are bound to be raised      did cyrus mistry act in the interest of minority shareholders of tata group companies when he blew the whistle  as many might say  on the accounts of tata led companies and spoke of a     billion write down       does tata sons act primarily in its own interests as a closely held company or as a custodian of minority shareholders of the companies it indirectly controls and manages for most part      will mutual funds  which are not usually known to be active in corporate battles in india  be led by investment advisory firms and the views of independent directors 
it is worthwhile recalling that ratan tata faced a controversy in the     s when tata sons wanted group led companies to pay fees for the use of the tata brand  shareholders were not exactly happy  tata sons continues to get brand fees  questions are bound to be raised on what tatas bring to the table 
unlike indira gandhi  who swept to power with her garibi hatao slogan in       mistry may not have similar charisma  but his call for accountability in corporate governance smacks of a similar appeal to minority shareholders and financial institutions  will government led financial institutions bat for the  syndicate  or the challenger 
whatever the detail  the case is reminiscent of the congress in       shareholder democracy and political democracy can have striking parallels
