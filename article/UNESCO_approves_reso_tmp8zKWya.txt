israel suspends cooperation with unesco over jerusalem resolution
in wednesday s secret ballot  the international body agreed to retain the site on the list of endangered world heritage and criticized israel for its continuous refusal to let the body s experts access jerusalem s holy sites to determine their conservation status  the document refers to the jerusalem site that jews called temple mount only by its arab name    a significant semantic decision also adopted by unesco s executive board last week that triggered condemnation from israel and its allies 
 quot this item should have been defeated     these politicized and one sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of unesco  quot  u s  ambassador crystal nix hines said in a statement to the associated press   quot these resolutions are continuously one sided and inflammatory  quot 
the american jewish committee and world jewish congress said nbsp ignoring    the jewish and christian connects to the holy sites in the city    damages attempts at coexistence and moves the israelis and palestinians further away from the prospect of peace  nbsp 
the resolution was passed by the world heritage committee s    member countries  ten countries voted for  two against    abstained and one was absent  neither israel  the u s  nor palestine is on the world heritage committee

elias sanbar  the palestinian ambassador to unesco  fired back at those upset with the resolution  which was sponsored by his delegation 
 quot what israel wants  in fact  is to put politics in religion  this is the most dangerous thing that is happening now in unesco  quot  sanbar told the ap   quot they are politicizing religion and this is very dangerous  quot 
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu wrote on facebook   quot to say that israel has no connection to the temple mount and the western wall is like saying that china has no connection to the great wall of china  quot 
u n  spokesman stephane dujarric responded  nbsp  quot the secretary general reaffirms the importance of the old city of jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions and stressed the importance of the religious and historical link of the muslim  jewish and christian people for the holy sites  quot 
the resolution is the latest of several measures at unesco over decades that israelis see as evidence of ingrained anti israel bias within the united nations  where israel and its allies are far outnumbered by arab countries and their supporters 
the site in jerusalem has been on unesco s endangered list since      
unesco s world heritage site list is known throughout the world for its work in highlighting sites of historic and cultural significance  and endangered global heritage
