the teaser of the mummy  which released last week  scared everyone out of their wits  the full theatrical trailer has been released now and it has only added to the goosebumps 
the trailer builds up on the teaser and traces the journey of the mummy from the fissure to resurrection and consequent destruction of the city  as tom cruise s character nick morton and his team are transporting the mummy via air  presumably for archaeological research  a perturbed expression is seen on the face of   morton as if he has foreseen the tragedy that lurks around them 
suddenly  the birds  which had been hovering around the mummy s casket while it was being lifted from the fissure  attack the plane carrying the casket  they just launch themselves through the cockpit causing the plane to crash  morton manages to save his love interest jenny halsey  played by annabelle wallis  by opening her parachute and pushing her off the aircraft  the plane goes on to crash and morton is presumed dead 
however  just like the mummy  morton also rises from the dead inside the mortuary  in the next shot  he is seen telling halsey that he saw the mummy  known as ahmanet  played by sofia boutella   getting resurrected   i saw her   she is real   morton says  his fear palpable 
the trailer proceeds to ahmanet gaining power and causing havoc in the city as morton and hasley run away from her  no brownie points for guessing that the two will have to confront the evil force at some point of time  how thrilling would that be 
the mummy is an adventure action thriller and is a reboot of the mummy trilogy starring brendan fraser and rachel weisz as richard and evie respectively  it is directed by alex kurtzman and the horror film is slated to release on   june
