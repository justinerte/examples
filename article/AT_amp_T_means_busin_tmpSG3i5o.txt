 g and its multi gigabit cellular speeds probably won   t hit the market until       but one corporate customer of at amp t is about to taste what it may be like 
at amp t is launching its first customer trial of  g technologies     the first  g trial for any business user in the u s   the carrier believes  but this is no average customer that happened to draw a golden ticket  the trial will take place at an intel facility in austin  texas  it will last about a month  use just one cell site  and cover an area with a radius of approximately     meters  at amp t said 
intel has been aggressively researching technologies for  g client and network equipment  it   s also notable that the silicon valley chip giant is one of the main counterweights to qualcomm when it comes to supplying the guts of smartphones  the mobile device industry  even including a goliath like apple  likes competitors to keep the big players honest 
at intel  at amp t and network equipment vendor ericsson want to demonstrate how  g could speed up business applications like vpns  virtual private networks  and unified communications  as well as  k video and regular internet access  they expect to see speeds that rival those of cable broadband 
at amp t and ericsson will be testing millimeter wave wireless  one of the main concepts expected to be part of  g  these systems can take advantage of wide bands of available frequencies  and new techniques and antenna designs are helping millimeter wave signals go beyond their traditionally short ranges 
the result should be very high speeds  some of the small trials that already took place this year showed speeds like  gbps  bits per second  for live  k video streams on sprint at a soccer game and even   gbps on super high   ghz frequencies at japan   s ntt docomo  at amp t  remaining conservative  said the upcoming trial will offer more than  gbps  which may be more realistic for multiple people sharing the network at intel 
the trial will test transmissions in the two bands    ghz  one of the frequency ranges that the u s  federal communications commission opened up for mobile service earlier this year  and   ghz  another promising band that sprint used for its  gbps test 
high speed is just one of the benefits  g is expected to bring  it   s also being designed for low latency  for things like fast reacting autonomous cars  and for connecting to many more tiny devices at low speed  the  g specification is scheduled for completion in       with commercial deployments starting in
