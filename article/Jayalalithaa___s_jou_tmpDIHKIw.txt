she was a rank outsider in tamil nadu rsquo s male dominated politics  a woman dismissed by critics as a mere actress and a brahmin leader in a state where anti caste dravidian ideology held sway 
but through her keen political acumen and leadership qualities  ndash  dictatorial tendencies to her critics  ndash  jayalalithaa jayaram transformed herself from a soft spoken actor to one of india rsquo s most powerful politicians who was feared and revered in equal measure 
under india rsquo s governance system  the prime minister and chief ministers are those supposed to be the  ldquo first among equals rdquo  
 ldquo but with her  she was only the first and there were no equals  rdquo  says political analyst ramu manivannan  this was her style of functioning  ndash  whether running the party or government  ndash  that won her a loyal following of millions  who were ready to even kill themselves for her wellbeing 
she died on monday at a chennai hospital as per local media reports  no other leader in contemporary tamil nadu politics combined charisma with benevolence to form a powerful brand that straddled three decades and left a deep imprint on the psyche of the people 


she was a six time chief minister  a brahmin leader of a dravidian party and a no nonsense administrator 
she was also a voracious reader who changed from an often emotional leader  ndash  she famously vowed to never return to the tn assembly unless elected cm after her sari was torn by dmk leaders  ndash  to a strong but impassive figure 
but as is the case with most powerful leaders and personality driven parties  jayalalithaa allowed herself to be guided by a small coterie  comprising her long time companion sasikala and her family  who wielded influence over government machinery

the    year old was brought into politics in the late     s by legendary movie star and then chief minister  mg ramachandran  better known as mgr  with whom she starred in more than     films 
three years after mgr rsquo s death in december       she took over his all india anna dravida munnetra khazagham  aiadmk  party  galvanising the support of the rural poor to win the      elections 
but over the next two decades  she surpassed her mentor  mgr  in terms of popularity as well as achievements 
she successfully built brand amma  under the umbrella of which she launched all her outreach welfare programmes for the poor  ndash  amma canteens  amma pharmacies  amma drinking water  amma cement  amma vegetables  and touched almost every activity of life  further endearing herself to the masses 


the iron hand with which she controlled the party and the government reflected her governance style  ndash  strong and dictatorial 
but  with no succession plan in place and the absence of a second rung  the ruling aiadmk could be battling for existence in the state it has ruled alternatively with the dmk for almost    years 
allies and adversaries agree on one thing  she was one of the most powerful politicians in the country  ndash  one of the few leaders who were not swept away by the  lsquo modi wave rsquo  that didn rsquo t get past the tamil nadu border 
 ldquo this lady is better than that  narendra  modi  rdquo  was how jayalalithaa made light of the then pm candidate at election rallies  drawing thunderous applause  the aiadmk won    of the state rsquo s    lok sabha seats in      
her trouble with the courts also dogged her political career with charges in a disproportionate assets case even landing her in jail in      
the case dates back to       ndash  when an ostentatious wedding for her foster son and a lavish display of personal wealth proved to her undoing  mdash  it evoked revulsion among people and eventually cost her the elections that year 
jayalalithaa was charged with amassing illegal wealth in       when police seized assets including    kg gold      pairs of shoes and more than        saris in a raid on her home  prosecutors said her assets  which reportedly included two       acre estates in the lush tropical state she ran  were vastly disproportionate to her earnings during her first term as chief minister from      to       when she took re   as salary 
jayalalithaa shared a good rapport with prime minister narendra modi and used it to the state rsquo s advantage  but when it came to electoral politics  she did not concede even as inch of space to the bjp 
though a chief minister  she was never too far from national politics and had one of the other time partnered the congress  the bjp and even the left 
the political strategist in her was at play when the state went to the polls earlier this year  she ensured that the opposition parties fought among themselves and not with her  she kept her job  a feat no other chief minister had achieved in more than    years 
she was a self taught woman and had joined the film industry as a teenager to help her family

as an administrator  she had clarity of thought and action with dazzling communication skills  her peers and subordinates often said  her strong persona only added to the aura 
she had the ability to understand issues quickly  take a stand and stick to it  she took briefings from the bureaucracy  instructed the bureaucracy and things were done as directed 


as the state moved towards industrialisation  her tough approach won her industry support  it was in her first stint as cm in      that jayalalithaa opened up the state economy  taking advantage of the liberalisation process initiated by then pm pv naraimsha rao and his finance minister manmohan singh 
big ticket foreign direct investments poured into tamil nadu  attracting giants such as ford and hyundai who turned state capital chennai into an automobile hub 
the industry noted her efforts to improve the power situation  as she withstood pressure from the powerful fishing community to build the kudankulam nuclear power plant  but not before driving a hard bargain with the centre to get extra safeguards 
whether it was mullaiperiyar dam issue or the cauvery river water sharing dispute with karnataka  she doggedly pursued cases  she ensured that the final award of the cauvery tribunal was notified in the gazette 
even on the sri lankan or tamil fishermen  jayalalithaa took a bold stand  and her letters to prime ministers  mdash  both singh and modi  mdash  were well known 
her strong administrative skills were demonstrated in tamil nadu rsquo s post tsunami relief and rehabilitation efforts  during which she posted the best officers on the ground and gave them a free hand 
clear instructions and close monitoring ensured that even foreign dignitaries such as hillary clinton appreciated the relief efforts 
but a few years later  when chennai was inundated by the worst floods in a century  mishandling of relief and poor government response marred her administrative record  it possibly also cost her many seats in the assembly polls that followed 
she often didn rsquo t have patience with critics and filed a string of defamation cases against the media and political opponents  earning rebuke from the supreme court
