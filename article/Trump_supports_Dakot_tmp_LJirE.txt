president elect donald trump supports the construction of a pipeline in north dakota  his spokesman said on monday when asked about the government rsquo s ruling against the controversial project 
 ldquo with regard to the dakota access pipeline  that rsquo s something that we support construction of and we rsquo ll review the full situation when we rsquo re in the white house and make the appropriate determination at that time  rdquo  trump spokesman jason miller said at a transition team news briefing  
thousands of protesters in north dakota celebrated after the federal government ruled against a controversial pipeline project but were mindful the fight is not over  as the company building the line said it had no plans for re routing the pipe 
the us army corps of engineers said on sunday it rejected an application to allow the dakota access pipeline to tunnel under lake oahe  a reservoir formed by a dam on the missouri river 
the decision came after months of protests from native americans and activists  who argued that the       mile        km  dakota access pipeline would damage sacred lands and could contaminate the tribe rsquo s water source 
energy transfer partners  in a joint statement with its partner  sunoco logistics partners  said late on sunday they do not intend to reroute the line  calling the obama administration rsquo s decision a  ldquo political action  rdquo  they said they still expect the project to be completed  noting that the army corps said they had followed all required legal procedures in the permitting process 
the mood among protesters has been upbeat since the rejection was announced on sunday afternoon at the oceti sakowin camp in cannon ball  north dakota  activists were seen hugging and letting out war cries in response to the news  
with the incoming administration of president elect donald trump supportive of the project  activists were concerned a reversal could be coming 
 ldquo this is a temporary celebration  i think this is just a rest  rdquo  said charlotte bad cob      from the pine ridge reservation in south dakota   ldquo with a new government it could turn and we could be at it again  rdquo  
the pipeline is complete except for a      km segment to run under lake oahe  that stretch required an easement from federal authorities  
the us army corps of engineers said it will analyse possible alternate routes  although any other route also is likely to cross the missouri river  
the protest camp rsquo s numbers have swelled in recent days  as hundreds of u s  veterans have flocked to north dakota in support of the protesters  some of those in a long line of traffic along highway      heading into the camp hollered and honked their horns after the news was announced  
craig edward morning      a carpenter from stony point  new york  said he will leave when the tribe says he should and the company agrees to stop building the line 
 ldquo they retreat first  rdquo  he said   ldquo they rsquo re the ones that aren rsquo t welcome  rdquo 
fight may be a  lsquo long haul rsquo 
standing rock chairman dave archambault ii  in a statement  said he hoped etp  north dakota governor jack dalrymple and trump would respect the decision 
 ldquo when it comes to infrastructure development in indian country and with respect to treaty lands  we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes  rdquo  he said 
trump has yet to react to sunday rsquo s decision  he could direct authorities to approve the line  even if before he takes over from democratic president barack obama on jan     federal authorities will be studying alternative routes  north dakota congressman kevin cramer  a republican  who has advised trump on energy policy  said the decision ignores the rule of law 
tom goldtooth  a lakota from minnesota  and a co founder of indigenous environmental network  said he expects trump to try to reverse the decision 
 ldquo i think we rsquo re going to be in this for the long haul  that rsquo s what my fear is  rdquo  he said  
in november  etp moved equipment to the edge of the missouri river to prepare for drilling  and later asked a federal court to disregard the army corps  and declare that the company could finish the line  that ruling is still pending 
several veterans recently arrived in camp told reuters they thought sunday rsquo s decision  which came just as oceti sakowin has seen an influx of service members  was a tactic to convince protesters to leave  those spoken to after the decision said they had no plans to leave because they anticipate heated opposition from etp and the incoming administration  
 ldquo that drill is still on the drill pad  until that rsquo s gone  this is not over  rdquo  said matthew crane      from buffalo  who arrived with a contingent of veterans last week
