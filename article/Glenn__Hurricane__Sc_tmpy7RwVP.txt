first comes the rain
there rsquo s a lot of rain in the southern u s  and much of it is heading our way  it rsquo s a sure bet to hit us tuesday afternoon and night  only the details of exact timing and rain amounts are in question  it looks like a nice  cold  soaking rain just the type to help ease the drought  but it also doesn rsquo t look heavy enough to cause a flood threat 
and here rsquo s what one of our computer models is showing for   p m  tuesday  around the peak of the event  

the yellow and reddish colors represent heavier rain  so i expect at least a brief period of downpours 
the area in blue is snow  and you rsquo ll notice some of it is dark blue  that represents heavy snow  but it rsquo s mostly confined to the northern part of pa  so  the poconos could see accumulating snow  perhaps even several inches  just a bit farther south  and at lower elevations  it should be just about all rain 
the arctic blast
i first had the dramatic drop in temperatures in my forecast from last tuesday  nov    th  that was day    of our    day forecast  the next day  i had a forecast high of only    degrees for friday  dec   th  nbsp  mdash  nbsp a full    degrees below normal  see  we can sometimes be precise in a forecast even ten days in advance  that rsquo s why we are the only ones to do a    day forecast every day 
here is what the arctic air mass looks like tonight  the coldest air has just moved down into montana from western canada  with temperatures near zero 

by the time the arctic air gets here on friday  it won rsquo t be as severe  here are the temperatures predicted by one model for first thing saturday morning 

those are low temperatures in the   s  but the wind at the time will probably make it feel like the teens  that rsquo s quite a change from our mild november 
the unseasonably cold weather should last through the weekend  but it won rsquo t be long lasting hellip  this time  here rsquo s the forecast from the  ldquo best of the best rdquo  that i rsquo ve described in the past  ensembles of the european model  the model is run    times  and the results averaged  

those blue and purple colors represent temperatures way below normal on december   th  it sure looks like december is going to turn out to be a much different type of month than november
