nepal rsquo s main opposition cpn uml party on monday accused india of interfering in the country rsquo s internal affairs as its students rsquo  wing staged a protest outside the indian embassy in kathmandu 
a day after india described the registration of a bill in parliament to amend the constitution to address the demands of agitating madhes based parties as an  ldquo important rdquo  step  the cpn uml said this amounted to a  ldquo grave intervention rdquo  in nepal rsquo s internal matters 
student and youth leaders rajiv pahari  nabina lama  niraj labaju and tilak thapa  who are close to several left wing parties  asked staffers of the indian embassy  ldquo not to interfere in nepal rsquo s political affairs rdquo   the activists were stopped some     metres from the embassy 
the cpn uml also accused india of putting pressure on nepal to approve the constitutional amendment bill  the party rsquo s activists criticised indian ambassador ranjit rae  alleging that his actions went against diplomatic norms and decorum 
on saturday  rae held a breakfast meeting with madhes based leaders and urged them to accept the constitutional amendment bill which they had rejected  
several student unions affiliated to political parties  including the left wing cpn ml  rastriya janamorcha  nepal workers and peasants party and cpn maoist  joined hands with the cpn uml rsquo s youth wing for the protest 
a group of opposition parties  including the cpn uml  has been opposing the bill on the grounds that it is  ldquo anti national rdquo   these parties have obstructed the proceedings of parliament since last wednesday  
nepal has been deeply polarised since the constitutional amendment bill was registered in parliament  madhes based parties too rejected the bill  saying it amounted to  ldquo little rdquo  and would not lead to much change in the present framework 
india has said that its consistent position has been that peace  stability and progress is in the interest of both countries  it has said it has supported the nepal government rsquo s efforts to meet the aspirations of all sections of society through  ldquo dialogue and constitutional processes rdquo
