last sunday  salman khan shocked the housemates of bigg boss     when he introduced them to the four wild card contestants in a very dramatic manner    supermodel jason shah  actors elena kazan and sahil anand  and ex contestant priyanka jagga made their way into the house and started competing with the existing contestants    post the    dome    task  which caused a lot of drama  four housemates were nominated for eviction  those being bani j  rahul dev  jason and elena 
they landed in the danger zone last week and were made to stay in a    jail     and now  when the evictions happened  it is elena who has been eliminated from the show after just one week of stay in the house  as the show host  salman khan said on weekend ka vaar   after announcing elena s elimination      elena s journey ended in just one week and even that one week  she spent in a small room  behind the bars  she couldn t enjoy the stay in the house with other contestants  it s all because of the audience votes  
well  no surprises there  the agent vinod actress hardly had any presence on the show  and that could be the reason of her getting lesser votes than other nominated contestants  however    elena attributes her early eviction largely to the format of the show 
elena feels that she as well as the other wild card entrants would have got noticed by the viewers if they were put in the house and then shifted to  jail     she elaborates     ideally the show organisers should have put us in the house for the first few days and then in the  jail  because then we would have got the chance to interact and mingle with the contestants  by being in jail right from the start  we got completely isolated and didn   t get the chance to create any impression in the minds of the viewers  audience didn   t get to know us at all    
however  she further adds     well  but the concept was designed in this way  i cannot have my point of view  it wasn   t designed to showcase me  and in any case everybody has been saying that the wildcard entrants never win  so i didn   t expect much  i am being realistic          but what is interesting is that i spent only one week in the house and i feel as if i was inside for a month  there were so many things happening inside  most of which was extreme  but there   s no clock in the house  so one wouldn   t know if it was morning or night  we were busy doing tasks and then there was this gong making a loud sound     she says 
elena is also of the opinion that the    dome    task that led to her nomination  could have been more creatively conceptualised  she partnered with nitibha kaul  she gave up and came out when nitibha decided to pee while inside the dome     who is going to pee first should not be the criteria  it was not my thing to pee inside the dome  and i would have never done so on national television  but yes  i did like the captaincy task of painting the canvas and the cycling task as well  these were fascinating concepts     says elena 
the german russian actress speaks fluent hindi since she has traveled widely across india  she debuted in cinema with a bengali movie called clerk opposite prosenjit chatterjee and went on to do movies like agent vinod  gandhi to hitler  prague and aasma among other projects  elena also has a strong point of view when it comes to promising contenders in the bigg boss house    she feels  gaurav chopra  vj bani and priyanka jagga are good players   gaurav is intelligent and calm  bani is also quite smart and priyanka is tough and competitive  she wants to win   says elena  who is happy to be out of the house because of the  tough stay  non cooperative contestants and dirty and messy surroundings  
elena  who was stationed in a small jail area in the house  says    it was all so disorganised  the contestants would take lot of time to prepare food  it was so taxing and tough  and then the kitchen and the entire house was so dirty  they would eat stuff  throw things around and would tell each other to clean the kitchen  otherwise i was fine with the competition       further  pointing out lopamudra   s attitude  elena says     we were continuously peddling and lopa was trying to tell us that she   s working very hard just because she had to make the food for us  where is the comparison between cooking and peddling for day and night  who would want to stay in a house like that  i was really upset with lopa    
while giving her opinion on manveer s accident when he fell on his head during the captaincy task of canvas painting  elena says that it was clearly manveer   s fault as he had got too aggressive     i felt bad and was also glad that he didn   t hurt more but he was going crazy  he was snatching the paint brush from gaurav who was very calm    everybody was telling manveer to stay cool but he wasn   t listening     says elena  further adding     and it was wrong for people to call gaurav inhuman because he knew that there were people to take care of manveer and hence he continued with his task    
elena also felt that om swami was at times being targeted unnecessarily     agreed  swamiji did crazy things in the house but at times he was made the scapegoat even if he was not in the wrong    he was very cooperative  he once helped me in washing dishes  jason  sahil and i had good experience with him  he would chat with us and helped us a lot as we were in  jail   people were very callous and disrespectful towards him
