atlantic city   most people would associate atlantic city with donald trump  but it s the president elect s powerful son in law  jared kushner  whose real estate holdings are currently bedeviling this floundering seaside resort 
since       kushner s real estate company has owned seven acres of waterfront land at a northern corner of atlantic city  home decades ago to the garwood mills department store   property that sits yawningly vacant but  in typical atlantic city fashion  has also figured in a bribery plot that snagged a colorful middleman working on behalf of kushner 
kushner s company was never implicated  the city would like the property back 
kushner paid    million and promised an elaborate      million upscale condominium complex  the deal included a clause designed to prevent him from just sitting on the property 
but since       any legal right the city might have to regain control of the land has been tied to  market driven conditions   which means atlantic city s downturn allows kushner  husband of ivanka trump  to continue to do nothing 
kushner co   a billion dollar real estate firm presided over by jared as its chief executive and based in new york city  said there was nothing to report on the property and declined further comment 
on the waterfront
the story of the demise of trump s atlantic city properties is well known  trump plaza closed in       stripped by then of its branding  trump castle marina is now golden nugget  owned by another billionaire with a reality tv show  billion dollar buyer   tilman fertitta  and trump taj mahal  just out of bankruptcy and owned by carl icahn  closed this fall amid union strife 
atlantic city officials may have little control over casinos owned by billionaires 
but they are less inclined to give up on kushner s property in the northeast inlet   a section of town where casino levies have been reinvested into housing and attractions like the aquarium in nearby gardner s basin  and which remains an integral part of their vision 

the garwood mills site and its mirror across new hampshire avenue  gardner s basin  are some of the tantalizingly underperforming waterfront parts of the city  by next year  the northeast inlet will be at the tip of a     million boardwalk reconstruction project connecting all the way to margate 
 if we got it back  it d be really simple   said elizabeth terenik  the city s planning director   we d do a  request for proposals   which allows us to name a redeveloper and then negotiate  we d seek someone we feel confident would be consistent with the city s vision  
the city no longer sees residential as the best use of the area  at his most optimistic  mayor don guardian will reference baltimore s inner harbor 
the vacant garwood mills property  adjacent to the site of the old captain starn s restaurant that was also to be incorporated into kushner s plan  is now mostly popular with fishermen and people eating lunch with the view from their pickup trucks  it is currently assessed at about      million       taxes were about         
it sits at water s edge  facing brigantine past the absecon inlet  heralded by the statue of king neptune dividing it from gardner s basin  the low key collection of the city s best breakfast  gilchrist   laid back bar food  back bay ale house   summer r amp b concerts  crafters  and micro food truck and container bar scene  scales  fish heads   think philadelphia s spruce street harbor park  but tinier and funkier 
the city bought two of the lots in      for          from the old atlantic city transportation co   which had used the site for a trolley car barn  a third lot was purchased from the company in      for          
kushner once promised an upscale      unit luxury high rise condominium complex called the landings at caspian point  complete with  public waterfront esplanade    a kind of mini trump village to be developed by his company s westminster communities arm  later  the plan was scaled back to low rises  then mothballed 
two years ago  atlantic city officials again explored getting the property back under a clause that was part of the      sale  to prevent a developer from holding onto the land but doing nothing with it  but with the change  the  reverter  clause could only be invoked if market conditions   housing prices  time on market   met certain threshholds  unlikely in the current climate 
prosecutor s office
like a lot of protracted atlantic city real estate deals  this one found its way to the prosecutor s office  in this case  then u s  attorney christoher j  christie  the same prosecutor who put kushner s father in jail  and may have paid the political price going forward with kushner s father in law  trump  
in       former city council president craig callaway and two councilmen pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes related to developing sites  including the garwood mills site  in a scheme federal authorities dubbed  steal pier   also pleading guilty was edward dinicolantonio  a wheeler and dealer of atlantic city politics  who touted deals for garwood mills and other contracts as a consultant   eddie dinic   as he was known  was sentenced to nine months of house arrest for paying         in bribes to two city councilmen to grease the skids for developers  dinicolantonio died nov    at age    
kushner co  was never charged  repeated attempts by city administrations to wrestle the property back failed 
terenik  the planning director  says the reverter clause in the city s redevelopment agreement uses residential markers to prevent the city from obtaining the land  which it now wants for commercial development  the city can point to stockton university s campus now being built at the opposite corner of town as proof that projects can move ahead 
 it took into consideration  if the market was bad  they did not have to act on it   she said   in other words  it would allow them more time  
time has never been in short supply for this parcel of land  it s been vacant since       when garwood mills burned down  after kushner s purchase  it was not long before elected officials began voicing their impatience 
in       city attorneys under then mayor scott evans tried to reacquire the land  but in       under mayor lorenzo langford  the amendments were added tying any reversion to market conditions 
fast forward to the current era  with atlantic city under state control and the gardner s basin potential remaining like so much else  stymied by forces outside its borders  a plan to open a new distillery there  the site of old rum runners  was prevented by the state  which cited a green acres designation on the site  just last week  little water distillery was finally licensed as the city s first legal distillery  at another underutilized site      baltic ave 
city council president marty small said the kushner site also deserves better   whether the property is in kushner s hands or the city of atlantic city s  it s in the best interest of that jewel to be developed   small said
