tamil nadu chief minister jayaraman jayalalithaa broke every major rule of the very dravida movement that shaped her political career  even as she honourably led a powerful party born from the movement   the reasons lie in her extraordinary ability to connect with poor voters and administrative bureaucrats alike and tapping deeper elements of a social psyche  while keeping everyone else guessing on her next move   especially leaders of her own all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam  aiadmk   the media and above all  her bitter rival dravida munnetra kazhagam  dmk  and its leader  muthuvel karunanidhi 
in sanskrit  the name jayalalithaa can be translated as  the playfully victorious one   true to her character  she kept everyone guessing from her bed at the apollo hospital in chennai until the last moment  true to her character  she fought with every breath before passing away   by the conventional rules of tamil nadu and indeed  indian politics  jayalalithaa was up against three major forces  male dominance  anti brahmin sentiment and rationalist thought  she pooh poohed them all in her political moves 
the dmk is busy marking     years of the justice party founded by the late ev ramaswamy naicker as its own century  naicker was an atheist who fought brahmin dominance  his party later became the dravida kazhagam  representing what it called the non aryan southern communities against northern and brahmin dominance  giving birth to the dravida movement 
the dmk was carved out of the dk by the late cn annadurai  anna   mg ramachandran  jayalalithaa s co star in many tamil movies and later her political mentor  broke away from the dmk after anna s death from the karunanidhi led dmk to form the aiadmk   mgr was a keralite by birth and jayalalithaa traced her origins to mysuru in karnataka where she was born in the nearby temple town of melukote into an iyengar brahmin family 
both led the aiadmk with aplomb  never mind the fact that the dmk rode to power in an anti hindi movement that spoke for tamil pride and also railed against sanskrit  its parent  and brahmins  linked to that language 
by dmk s streetsmart yardsticks  jayalalithaa was every inch non dravidian   born outside tamil nadu  of brahmin parentage  and a soft spoken english educated woman in a tribe of patriarchal  often misogynist  men   jayalalithaa succeeded with some formulae picked up from her mentor  and some style of her own  women  farmers and the thevar community have formed the backbone of aiadmk s politics  which has retained strong support for core dravida priorities such as job reservations for backward castes while harnessing support elsewhere 
the religious thevars eagerly backed jayalalithaa  a devout hindu happy to perform yagnas and pose in temples while leading a big part of the once proudly atheist dravida movement  the reasons for her success can be seen in every street corner of tamil nadu  where temples abound to many gods  women are among the most devout  jayalalithaa s closest friend has been sasikala natarajan  herself from the thevar community  though she was kept outside party politics of late  o panneerselvam  the leader s chief political aide and government head in her absence  is also a thevar 
jayalalithaa also aggressively pursued welfare programmes for the poor with a focus on women  mgr launched the mid day meal scheme in schools lauded by the world bank  while jayalalithaa launched her cut rate  amma canteens  to feed the poor  her most recent poll plank in her comeback victory this year included a scooter subsidy for women and special maternity aid for the pregnant   jayalalithaa also defied karnataka s rulers time and again as she fasted and fought in courts and tribunals to get more waters from the cauvery river for tamil nadu s farmers  who were key to her grassroot support base 
while doing all this  the leader knew how to handle the bureaucracy  although she joined the world of cinema to help her family and did not pursue her college degree  her stellar academic record at chennai s elite church park convent stood her in good stead as she handled bureaucrats and files with aplomb  equally fluent in english and tamil   but in all this  she knew how to keep her glamour quotient high  whether it was living in a palatial home  moving in a convoy of cars that made her look like a head of state  or in defying critics to stage a lavish royal style wedding for an adopted son  the visual pomp gave for the masses a figure they held in awe  a series of corruption cases   including one in which she was temporarily convicted   did nothing to dampen her style or dent her image among the masses 
her comeback in the last state election only showed that her extraordinary connection with tamil nadu s people was beyond the conventional thinking of those weaned on simple equations of caste  language and egalitarian socialism  mystique and mystery were central to her politics
