mumbai   fc goa and chennaiyin fc finished at the bottom of the indian super league despite retaining successful coaches from the previous editions  while all four teams who have qualified for the semi finals had new coaches at the helm 
the two legged semi finals of season   will see first time play off qualifiers mumbai city battle for a final spot against former champions atletico de kolkata  while delhi dynamos and kerala blasters would jostle for the other spot 
the  st leg of the semi finals are to be held on    december  kolkata  and    december  kochi  followed by the return leg on    december  mumbai  and    december  delhi  
the final is on    december at kochi 
the likes of gianluca zambrotta  delhi dynamos   jose molina  atletico de kolkata   alexandre guimaraes  mumbai city fc  and steve coppell  kerala blasters   did not have an idea of what to expect but still managed to stay in the race 
on the other hand  the failure of zico  fc goa   marco materazzi  chennaiyin fc  and antonio habas  fc pune city  to take their teams to the play offs reflects the changing dynamics in the league  according to some experts 
paul masefield  felt the failure of top coaches was due to a culmination of factors  among them the ability of other clubs to strengthen their squad considerably  failure to lure key players and under performing marquee players for fc goa and chennaiyin fc 
 the league is stronger and more competitive now as you only have to look at the results     said masefield  a former birmingham city fc player 
 fresh ideas  ethos and understanding of the game has definitely helped these sides  also i think that they have  fallen  upon a system that works for their team   he said 
ricki herbert  former head coach at new zealand and northeast united fc feels isl is evolving in tactical and strategic implementation 
 the isl will continue to grow in a number of areas and this certainly includes the quality of teams and players  the understanding of tactical and strategic implementations are evolving and coaches are always looking to find a cutting edge to make the defining difference
