editor s note  this piece was originally published on    october        when the then  finance minister of tamil nadu o  panneerselvam took over the late jayalalithaa s portfolios  this is being updated and republished in light of her death 
on late monday night   apollo hospitals and aiadmk announced the passing away of tamil nadu chief minister j jayalalithaa  who suffered a massive cardiac arrest on sunday evening  she passed away at       pm on monday  after battling for life for    days  apollo hospitals said in a statement   two hours after the announcement of her death  in a swift political transition  her loyalist o panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister at a sombre ceremony at the raj bhawan  along with all the ministers in the erstwhile jayalalithaa cabinet 
the announcement of    year old o  panneerselvam comes as no surprise for those keenly following  tamil nadu politics  he is  after all  her permanent understudy 
this is the fourth time in his career that the   amma  loyalist has stepped up for his leader  first  in september       where he was the interim chief minister for six months  when jayalalithaa was  disqualified  by the supreme court in the tansi land deal case  second in september       after a  bangalore court sentenced jayalalithaa to four years in jail and fined rs     crore in a corruption case  and third when jayalalithaa was admitted to apollo hospital since    september  after she complained of fever and dehydration  and continued to remain there  but then she continued to serve as the chief minister 
for those in the know   panneerselvam has been repeatedly chosen as a caretaker of the tn government as he was seen as the  most loyal   writes the hindu  but that might have changed  opines the news minute although he did find a place in the      cabinet   the piece said that  the first sign of cracks between panneerselvam and jayalalithaa appeared when the former was not included in seat sharing talks and electoral committee meetings      all because of an alleged hashtag   ops cm  that made the rounds on twitter  aiadmk supporters claimed that it was the work of dmk s it wing to start a rift between the two  but soon it looked like the rift was forgiven 
so  who is panneerselvam 
in her biography of the tamil nadu chief minister  amma  jayalalithaa s journey from movie star to political queen  vaasanthi writes that  panneerselvam  who belongs to the thevar community  was a son of a  poor farmer  and a   humble man  known  for his modesty   she writes about the first time that  panneerselvam was asked to step in her shoes 
he and all the ministers who were  sworn in afresh fell at jayalalithaa   s feet and sought  her blessings  amma looked amazingly calm as she  accepted their obeisance  for all practical purposes  it was she who was still  the chief minister  it was said that panneerselvam had  moved into the compound of poes garden and all  the files went for her scrutiny before he signed  in the  corridors of government offices  they waited for amma  to come back 
panneerselvam  along with his friend vijayan  set up a tea stall  pv canteen  now named rosie canteen   in the     s  writes scroll  a decade later  the canteen was handed over to his younger brother and  mild mannered panneerselvam subsequently entered politics in       reports news     and became the chairperson of the periyakulam municipality in theni district 
panneerselvam has prostrated before jayalalithaa  deified  her and wept for her  he also meticulously followed her  orders  coordinated with bureaucrats and proved himself a   mature leader and team player 
after jayalalithaa was acquitted in the tansi case in  mid december  vaasanthi writes that  poor  panneerselvam  was the most relieved   
    who  like bharata waiting for  rama   s return from his exile in the forest  was waiting  for amma   s return   
discounting the fact that he was only an interim cm  panneerselvam  who disclosed his personal assets  revealed that they were worth only rs     lakh  taking into account his liabilities  according to a report in the hindu  it also adds that the bodi constituency candidate does no own any immovable properties  but that his wife  has properties worth over one crore 
panneerselvam sworn in
a grim faced panneerselvam was sworn in as chief minister of tamil nadu at around      am by governor ch vidyasagar rao at the raj bhavan amidst a scene of gloom   panneerselvam took oath as cm with a photo of jayalalithaa in his pocket 
as chief minister  panneerselvam will hold all portfolios held by jayalalithaa including home  besides finance  panneerselvam retained all members of the jayalalithaa cabinet
