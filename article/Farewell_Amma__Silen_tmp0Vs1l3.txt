since sunday  when news of her cardiac arrest broke  apollo hospital and greams lane has seen a huge crowd of boisterous amma supporters 
tears  fury  and a defiant confidence in jayalalithaa rsquo s guaranteed recovery gave way to sadness and frustration as local tv channels falsely reported her demise on monday evening 
but the hospital ground is now empty of her supporters  with only a heavy police presence and journalists present at     pm when the news of her demise was made official 
chennai was tense  with many shopkeepers closing shutters as a precaution after there were sporadic outbreaks of violence earlier on monday following the false news broadcasts 


the authorities appear to have waited until the crowd rsquo s had fully dispersed and returned home before making the announcement  the question now is how the security forces will maintain law and order in a state which has seen riots following the death of popular politicians in the past 
at least       police personnel  including companies from both the armed reserve and tamil nadu special police  were called in as reinforcements by the chennai police as part of their security plan  a unit of the rapid action force  raf  was also present at apollo hospital  where the    year old has been convalescing since september     to assist forces already deployed there 


the focus across the state that jayalalithaa has ruled as chief minister six times is now on the meeting of her mlas currently underway at the aiadmk party headquarters in royapettah  and who now will be chosen as her successor 
while finance minister o panneerselvam  who has stood in for jayalalithaa as an interim cm twice before  appears to be a current favourite  it rsquo s unclear whether any initial appointment made now will be permanent or not

party cadre workers initially charged barricades and began hysterically crying when the rumours of her demise surfaced  after several local channels  including  ironically  jaya tv  announced that she had died early on monday evening  the brief scuffle continued for a few minutes until chennai police were able to control the crowd 
apollo hospital swiftly denied the rumours  saying that the    year old was still alive  and was undergoing medical treatment 


the    year old has been in hospital since september     on sunday afternoon her condition further deteriorated after she suffered a cardiac arrest during a meeting with one of her doctors 
to her supporters and her party loyalists  she was the comeback queen  a  ldquo fighter rdquo   in the words of mdmk chief vaiko  but it is unclear how they will react now that their beloved puratchi thalaivi has died 
that uncertainty will now make many chennaites wary of what will come next
