hayes: pederson should bench mcleod, ertz for soft play
http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/20161206_hayes__pederson_should_bench_mcleod__ertz_for_soft_play.html
marcus hayes is a sports columnist for the daily news  hired more than    years ago as a features writer  he has since covered the eagles  phillies  and sixers beats as well as big five basketball  college football  golf  and the olympics 
little else turns the stomach like watching football players quit 
their job is brutal  their nature  brutish  yet they choose this life and they are paid like princes to perform  and they never turn down their paychecks  it is their job to fight and flail and finish 
the eagles failed in cincinnati  some worse than others 
you saw it 
we all saw it 
doug pederson saw it  too 
he saw safety rodney  no thanks  mcleod refuse to hit bengals running back jeremy hill at the goal line sunday  he saw tight end zach  el matador  ertz refuse to block vontaze burfict on a quarterback run 
pederson saw it all  it made him sick  too 
asked monday whether all of his players played hard in cincinnati  pederson replied 
 not everybody  
you heard that correctly  the head coach of an nfl team in a blue collar town acknowledged that his players are tanking  stealing money  playing soft 
in the     area code  that s heresy  you might punk out in the baseball heaven that is st  louis  where mcleod spent his first four nfl seasons  but  in the delaware valley  refusing to block and declining to tackle warrants benching 
not every eagle plays this way  a week earlier  offensive lineman allen barbre knocked packers linebacker clay matthews out of the game with a hellacious block  then again  barbre makes only       million  barbre can be cut at any time 
ertz signed a   year        million extension in january  mcleod signed a   year      million free agent contract in march  you have to stay healthy to enjoy that money 
professional athletes respond to two types of discipline  you can take their cash or you can take their pride  being benched is the more visible  more effective shame  that s what this pair deserves 
no one should be more outraged than pederson  their advocate  their defender  the benevolent dictator who often says he ll  love  em up   well  dougie  it s time for some tough love 
the game ended        but the plays involving mcleod and ertz happened with the bengals ahead       in the first quarter  both plays could have set a more physical tone in an absolute must win game that would have evened the eagles  record at     and kept them relevant in the playoff race  both plays let the bengals know that the eagles did not come to fight 
the question in question was the third of its kind during the monday postmortem  pederson clumsily evaded the first two  as the postmortem grew to a close  grizzled radio and tv reporter howard eskin  a visible irritant of the towns  teams for three generations  gave it another shot  eskin named mcleod in his question  and  typically in eskin fashion  he did not feign any professional decorum  eskin demanded an answer with the fully biased outrage of a zealot betrayed 
it was answered with the fully righteous outrage of a coach betrayed 
certainly  the answer indicts the answerer  pederson s first responsibility each week is to judge which players will play best  in football  a gladiator sport whose first criteria for success is effort 
it also indicts general manager howie roseman  who compiled the roster  it also indicts team leaders such as safety malcolm jenkins  the team s unquestioned spokesman  and left tackle jason peters  who last week personally guaranteed that the eagles would not quit  neither spoke to the press after sunday s heartless loss  so much for leadership 
it was as absent after the game as it was lacking during the game 
somehow  against a bengals team that won only once in the past two months  the eagles trailed        with about    minutes to play  somehow  against a bengals team that had allowed the fourth most sacks in the nfl  the eagles managed none 
eskin used mcleod s end zone deferral as the example  it was an apt example 
the bengals went ahead        late in the first quarter  two plays earlier  they completed a    yard pass to cody core  on which mcleod also seemed uninterested in unnecessary contact  he was late to help cornerback nolan carroll  he pulled up as the pass was completed  perhaps hoping for an incompletion or that core would step out of bounds  and  finally  he rode core down at the eagles    yard line 
then  on second and goal from the    the embarrassment 
mcleod was the only third level defender  which made sense  since he has built a reputation as a stout tackler  he stood three yards deep in the end zone  after the snap  every defensive lineman and linebacker was blocked  a hole opened in the middle  hill took the ball at the   and plunged toward it  mcleod was unblocked  he took two steps toward the hole  and toward hill       then stopped  just stopped  hill dived into the end zone at mcleod s feet 
hill ran    total yards  mcleod ran two yards  mcleod  whose only job is to stop the ball  essentially let hill score 
there was no misdirection  mcleod just quit 
somewhere  brian dawkins cringed 
brent celek should be just as disgusted 
for a decade  celek has defined tight end toughness for philadelphia  he will retire an immensely popular player  because  with or without the ball  celek invites contact 
ertz  his successor  might be run out of town because he avoids it  he has built an unassailable reputation as a catch and drop receiver  ertz s predisposition to self preservation reached a new high  new low   in the middle of the first quarter 
carson wentz scrambled up the middle  then angled toward the right sideline  where ertz s route had taken him  six bengals chased wentz  the closest was burfict  a ferocious linebacker  ertz had a clean shot to block burfict  ertz is     and weighs     pounds  two inches taller and five pounds heavier than burfict 
ertz clobbered him  right  hardly 
like a bullfighter  ertz stepped aside  burfict ran right past  ole 
was ertz in position to block burfict  absolutely  instead  ertz actually tapped burfict on his back with his left hand as burfict rumbled by  as if inserting a banderilla  all ertz needed was a red cape and some tasseled slippers 
yes  wentz seemed likely to run out of bounds  which he did  but what if he hadn t  what if wentz evaded josh shaw on the sideline and turned his run upfield  then  burfict gets a free shot at the franchise 
 he just pulled off at that point   pederson said  clearly perturbed   that s all i can say about that  but i m definitely going to ask him why  obviously  we ask our guys to turn and block  
ertz issued a specious statement on monday afternoon that ran first on espn com in which he contended that he declined to hit burfict because he assumed wentz would  easily make it out of bounds  and that he believed the play was over when he reached burfict  wrong  wentz took three steps after burfict passed ertz 
ertz is second on the team  with    catches and     receiving yards  mcleod is half of the safety tandem that is  arguably  the most functional part of a dysfunctional team  the eagles host washington on sunday 
this goes beyond statistics and chemistry  this concerns heart  this concerns professionalism  pederson might come off as fatherly  but  in his rookie season  he has shown a stern hand 
pederson cut josh huff for an alleged criminal malfeasance  he sat nelson agholor for psychological distress 
benching two well paid veterans for tanking in a crucial game seems like an easier decision than either of those
