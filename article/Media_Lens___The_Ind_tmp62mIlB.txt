the bloody history of western support for indonesia s illegal annexation of east timor in      is glossed over in a recent news report by kathy marks in the independent   australia bows to east timor over oil and gas rights     july         australian ministers are portrayed as generous in agreeing to give east timor    per cent of revenues from oil and gas reserves in the timor sea  lying between australia and east timor to the north  the report fails to explain that the agreement was struck following australia s  pragmatic  support of indonesia s brutal annexation of east timor in       leading to the deaths of around         east timorese 
official documents reveal that indonesia s annexation of east timor was supported by the west  in july       the british ambassador in jakarta informed the foreign office that  the people of portuguese timor are in no condition to exercise the right to self determination  and  the arguments in favour of its integration into indonesia are all the stronger    mark curtis  the ambiguities of power  zed books        p       
as documented by curtis  john pilger  noam chomsky and other commentators  the west   in particular  the us and the uk   actively supported suharto s indonesia in brutally subduing east timor  but the australian government was also complicit  richard woolcott  the australian ambassador in jakarta in       was tipped off by the indonesians that the invasion was about to take place  woolcott secretly cabled the department of foreign affairs  proposing that   we  leave events to take their course     and act in a way which would be designed to minimise the public impact in australia and show private understanding to indonesia of their problems    john pilger  hidden agendas  vintage        p        woolcott is quoted in the independent report as an authoritative  analyst   with no mention of his complicit role in the deaths of         east timorese  instead the report notes that  relations between australia and indonesia are recovering their traditional warmth    as the bitter memory of east timor fades  
the  private understanding  of australian ministers at the time of the illegal invasion of east timor clearly assisted in the subsequent carving up between australia and indonesia of the considerable oil and gas reserves covered by the timor gap treaty  signed in       indonesia under president suharto was a significant market for western arms sales  but by providing  political stability   suharto also offered western business interests the opportunity to benefit from the country s extensive mineral resources  nbsp  a few months before the      invasion of east timor  a confederation of british industry report noted that indonesia presented  enormous potential for the foreign investor  and that  according to one press report  the country enjoyed a  favourable political climate  and the  encouragement of foreign investment by the country s authorities    curtis  p       
curtis notes that  rtz  bp  british gas and britoil are some of the companies that have since taken advantage of indonesia s  favourable political climate     the independent s news report notes that philips petroleum is  one of the commercial driving forces behind the oil and gas exploration   an executive at philips is quoted as saying that the new oil and gas agreement should  provide a secure legal and fiscal level that supports continued investment  
however  an honest appraisal of the historical record reveals that the establishment of political conditions conducive to western corporate interests   using military power either directly  or indirectly with the aid of proxy forces  as in suharto s indonesia   at immense cost to human life has been a necessary condition for economic globalisation in this region 
please ask the independent to address the background to the recently announced oil and gas deal between australia and east timor  in particular  the role that australia played in supporting indonesia s brutal invasion of east timor in      and subsequent occupation  unlike in kosovo  there was no  humanitarian intervention  for the east timorese in the subsequent    years  point out that in the run up to the east timor independence referendum in august       indonesian backed atrocities were running at considerably higher levels than in kosovo
