tucked in a corner of south delhi   s kailash colony  writer and academician purushottam agrawal sits at his desk surrounded by hordes of books  most of them hindi titles  shelves behind him packed to the brim with tomes that cut across not only age  but also languages with titles from calvino to a personal favourite in nirmal verma 
contrary to the kind of ethos we will be chasing in the conversation to follow  there are pressing concerns that are visibly afflicting agrawal  like the rest of the country     i needed some heavy cash for a hospital emergency just days ago  if my wife  she joins us at this time to offer me tea  hadn   t had some money stashed away  i would have been helpless because none of the atms in the neighbourhood are working     he says  the finance minister does not live far from the place 
agrawal has been at the forefront of many things  from campaigns against communalism while he was a student at jnu  to the re conceptualisation of modernity in hindi literature  he has done it all  his latest foray into literature  however  is oblique in the sense that joseph conrad would interpret it 
since march of       agrawal has anchored the television show kitab on that austere  yet sophisticated anomaly on indian television  rajya sabha tv     the idea came to me in january  i did not know at the time if any shows like it existed on television already  but i was keen on it  but i had my doubts as well  who would be interested     he says  the ceo of rajya sabha tv gurdeep singh sappal happened to be at his house when the idea was openly discussed for the first time  three months later the show held its pilot run  with amartya sen as the guest and the parliament lawns as the venue 
a tv show on books  rather a talk show on books  was now on air  it ran for an hour  and it addressed only the    one    book  this was against everything that works in indian media     i did not want to talk about latest books  or even controversial ones  neither did i want to review them  i wanted to have a discussion around the book  which would be sustained by participation  something that was sappal   s idea     agrawal says  from then on the show had an audience  usually a young crowd  the episodes would be shot outdoors  preferably in colleges where students would engage with the discussion  however  having an hour long discussion around a single book isn   t the only thing that sets the show apart 
   we held shoots in shimla and karnataka  we did not shoot a show on mahasweta devi in bengal or jharkhand as we did not shoot the episode on amrita pritam in punjab  my idea is to re affirm and spread a diverse idea of india     agrawal says  kitab as the show is so aptly called  even on a mathematical level  travels not just between ages  but languages as well  there have been shows on chugtai  nirmal verma and abu   l fazl ibn mubarak   s akbarnama to name a few  aside from time and language  the show also delves into depths television in india rarely considers worth its time  kitab has  for what it is worth  had a full show on american political scientist francis fukuyama   s work  at which point it is important to understand the how and why of the choice 
   fukuyama interested me initially  by the time i had read his second book trust  i was convinced i needed to bring him into public discourse in india  and not for his opinions on india alone  he is a rare entity  someone who doesn   t claim to be a public intellectual but is still trying to connect with the masses     he says  in the episode for which jnu professor manindra nath thakur was the guest  agrawal also discussed something that is of immediate importance in the current political climate     nationalism     identity is an important word here  and as i mentioned during the show  it is difficult for post colonial countries to give up the idea of nationalism  because colonialism actually gave rise to it in the first place  though  i am against ethnic nationalism  i   m not against the idea of ethnicity itself     he adds 
though kitab is multi lingual  as is agrawal himself  there is a prescient emphasis on writers in regional languages  there is then the need to consider the state of that particular literary space in itself  continuously being encroached by the foreign  which agrawal feels is extremely disheartening  but he acknowledges the problems     for someone like nirmal verma  translation is easy because his influences were largely western  the problem arises with writers who are wholesomely indian in ethos and inspiration  to translate them is to undertake an undoable task  that said  there should at least be an effort     he says  but does translation alone solve the problem in a country that is consciously moving towards a language no more its own  but rather  its aspiration      i couldn   t agree more  english is not just a language  it is an aspiration in our country  people read in english  but then it is also an opportunity  we are one of the luckiest cultures where we are at the least bilingual  if not multilingual  so if someone  even in today   s day and age  can only speak and write in one language  then he has only himself to blame     agrawal says 
language  of course  at times can be more restrictive than it is a getaway card that clothes our escapism  for example  for even a bilingual reader or writer  does he subconsciously  simply  translate himself  does he read emotion and reality in hindi  but write in english  at which point english becomes the language of our intellect while hindi remains  naturally  the language of our emotions  agrawal believes it is an open ended question     one that we ourselves need to find the answer to     even nirmal verma was criticised for thinking in english and writing in hindi  i think it is down to the individual  because ultimately it has to work for him     he says 
how long will kitab work  and stay on  defying every known construct of a populist media we are familiar with     i don   t know     agrawal says     i hope it does     and so should we
