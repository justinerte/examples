she was an incredible woman  person  totally  defying description  out of the box  no template can ever capture her  nor adequate words describe the range of her extraordinary personality 
cliches never applied to her in life  nor will they thereafter  she towered over the landscape of tamil nadu rsquo s passionate political scene  from       soon after her mentor mgr introduced her to the aiadmk  and stepped out of his shadow  to serve as chief minister of this important  highly politicised and polarised state 
just like indira gandhi  whom she admired  she was    in my view disparagingly    known as  ldquo the only man in her cabinet rdquo   by any standards  such a statement is grossly unfair  to women in general and j jayalalithaa in particular  she did not have to be a man to be strong  and she proved the contrary  while she rose to power  and during the course of her career  she fiercely fought these very stereotypes and annihilated them with courage and contempt  and in power  she rose way above mere gender stereotypes to be a leader who was loved and respected and implicitly obeyed 
she was  without doubt  imperious  soon after her first election as chief minister  i was chatting with her at a dinner in chennai  both of us holding plates of food  nobody else ventured near  to join our conversation  however  a large number of her party leaders began to prostrate themselves on the floor  and while one after the other continued to do this  she barely spared them a glance  simply continued to talk to me 
i must confess to a moment of satisfaction that so many men in our still male chauvinistic society were genuflecting to this strong woman  this last term  however  i believe  she gave instructions  that her party colleagues should avoid genuflection 
her legacy is inevitably of a mass charismatic leader  who kept the aiadmk together after the death of mgr  i do not believe any other leader could have managed this 
some may call her welfare schemes populist and election oriented but without going into the economics of it  there can be little doubt that her amma canteens  amma pharmacies  and other important schemes have earned her an iconic and beloved status in the hearts of tamilians 
she genuinely believed in the rights of women  and wanted to empower them  tamil nadu has the largest number of women police stations for any state in the country  and these police stations actually work 
the election promise she fulfilled of giving every girl student who passed class    a bicycle  in my view  is one of the most important  praiseworthy  woman empowering initiatives any chief minister has implemented in independent india  the mobility  the sense of freedom  the sense of purpose  the feeling of having a control over their own lives this bicycle gave the young girls in our villages  is something that should go down in our country rsquo s history in letters of gold 
it seems like such a simple promise  but i witnessed first hand the empowerment it provided to thousands of young girls  for me  this alone  is achievement enough 
she brought industry to the state  particularly in the auto sector  and was quick to fight  loud and hard  for the rights of tamil nadu  the state has lost a vociferous  fearless champion 
it was a delight to watch her in the legislature  armed to perfection with facts  figures and details and a formidable opponent in a debate    when debates happened 
she spoke and wrote at least five languages with great fluency and as a child  i remember stepping into her library at her home and being awe struck  she loved books and reading  when she attended my wedding in       she gave me books as a present because she knew i loved reading too  however  all the time  she was at my reception nobody looked at the bride or groom  only at her  such was her charisma   even then 
politically  we were often in opposite camps  and she was unrelenting in her displeasure  in fact  she was unrelenting even as an ally  i remember  one time when my then party  the tmc  was in alliance with her and seat sharing talks had run into rough weather  while all of us from tmc were at a public meeting commemorating our foundation day  news channels were broadcasting the aiadmk candidates and their seats  we had to take it or leave  the paltry number she had left for us  there were many red faces on the podium that evening 
perhaps  that is the essence of jayalalithaa  she was a fighter  a brave  gutsy  feisty daring fighter  and she gave nor expected any quarter  her path was never easy  and her tribulations formidable  but she fought her way through politics and life with grim tenacity and a vastly superior intelligence 
she took risks that no politician would normally take    she spurned  rejected  sometimes scorned allies  and always wanted to fight electoral battles on her own terms  but  these gambles brought her rich dividends and earned her the respect of not just party colleagues but of the entire political class 
tamil nadu after her is a conundrum  the vacuum is immense  the opposition dmk is strong and organised but the aiadmk will have a very difficult time in finding someone who can even remotely fill the space she has left behind  if the aiadmk remains united  and strong  it can carry forward the legacy of mgr and jayalalithaa  and continue to be a driving force in tamil nadu politics but time alone can tell if their efforts will meet with success
