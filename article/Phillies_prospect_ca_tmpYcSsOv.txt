oxon hill  md    dylan cozens left the winter meetings on monday afternoon with an        check tucked in his right pocket  almost doubling the amount of money the phillies prospect earned last season 
cozens was honored at an afternoon banquet with the joe bauman award for leading all of minor league baseball last season in home runs  he received      for each of the    homers he hit with double a reading 
cozens joked during the luncheon that he made more monday than he did all of last season  the rightfielder earned roughly        per month last season  minor league players are only paid during their five month season  which means cozens made roughly        last season   he received a          signed bonus after he was drafted in       
 i don t know if it s true   it s a joke  not to be taken too seriously   cozens said   but  yeah         will make shopping this holiday season a lot easier  
cozens returned last month from a    game stint in the dominican winter league  the    year old struggled there  as he batted just      and got in a fight with a teammate  cozens    foot        pounds  punched boog powell of seattle during batting practice after powell             mocked cozens for not being able to hit breaking pitches 
 just a little boys being boys type thing   cozens said   i feel like it was blown out of proportion  like almost everything is these days  but after it happened  we became good friends  it was more the level of respect there and i d say we re still friends  so it s good  
phillies general manager matt klentak said  there is no concern  about cozens after the incident  cozens slipped to the second round of the      draft after an altercation with a high school baseball coach 
 dylan is an intense kid and he plays the game really hard  that is a good thing   klentak said   if you ve watched that  you can see that in his at bats and when he runs the bases and is running around in the outfield  that s just his style of play  that aggressive nature at times can boil over  you hope that it doesn t boil over in altercations with teammates  but we have no long term concerns with that at all  
cozens  who struck out     times last season  whiffed    times in    dominican at bats  he did hit four homers  each against lefthanded pitching  it was a good sign for the lefthanded hitter after just five of last season s    homers came again lefties  he also walked    times in    games 
 i m learning how to take my walks more often  having better strike zone judgment  maybe not chase after as many pitches   cozens said   be aggressive  but if they don t want to pitch to me  just take a walk  i feel like i did not so good of a job of that  but it s something i can improve on next year  
cozens will return to clearwater  fla   in two months for his first major league spring training  he was added last month to the    man roster  which means he will earn more than        per month this season  and he also will likely start the season in triple a  just one step from the majors and an even bigger payday 
 i just go into camp looking to keep getting better   cozens said   obviously  i want to be there as soon as possible  but it s not my call  i m just going to go out there and get better  turn some heads  make some people notice  and hopefully get called up as soon as possible
