what we talk about when we talk about 5g wireless | network world

so what is  g  exactly  anyway 
well  if you   re asking about    exactly     it doesn   t exist yet 
oh  that helps me a lot 
sorry  but the best answer to your question is probably that  g is sort of a catch all name to describe the next generation of carrier wireless technology that   s going to be slinging tweets and videos and connected home signals from the internet to your smartphone or your smartwatch or  really  any smart object you   ve got handy   the target speed for  g connectivity is anywhere from    mbps to  gbps  depending on context and who you   re asking  even at the lower bound  that   s roughly    times faster than the u s  average  g connection   according to a february report from opensignal 
so aside from increased speed why   s it better than  g  haven   t we had enough gs 
oh  not hardly  you see   g     like  g  and the rest of the gs  in fact     is entirely a marketing term  meant to give an overview of a certain generation of carrier wireless tech  most of what we   ve got in this country that we refer to as  g is called lte  although regular lte isn   t quite  g  according to standards groups  and lte advanced 
it   s a marketing term  but it   s also a standard  what 
it   s confusing  without question  the standards body that   s responsible for wide area     that is to say  carrier     wireless technology is  gpp  and while they   ve codified a set of capabilities that qualify as     g     they   re not done doing the same thing for  g 
  related           the year  g wireless testing really took off  
so when are they going to be finished with that 
best guesses from the experts are that the standards work at the international telecommunication union and the subsequent reference designs from  gpp     which these groups undertake in partnership with basically everybody who has a stake in what the eventual technology will look like  including gadget makers  carrier equipment manufacturers  the carriers themselves  and many more     around      or      
so that   s when we   ll see  g 
not exactly  a standard is just a definition of what a  g system is supposed to do  it   s not an actual technical design for that system  while there   s a lot of testing and development underway already     and we could even see the odd piece of    pre standard     g technology released here and there      g tech won   t take the consumer market by storm until      at the earliest  and possibly not until      or later 
the big question  then     what   s it going to look like when it gets here 
   cool     in a word   g wireless is going to be complex and powerful  able to handle both the raw bandwidth demands of the near future and the huge increase in the number of connected devices  as cars and refrigerators and light switches join smartphones and tablets on the airwaves  it   ll use lower frequency radios to cover large areas  like now  with lots of optimizations to permit more connections per access point  as well as larger numbers of millimeter wave base stations to provide enormously fast throughput speeds to areas of dense demand 
that is cool 
no kidding 
more   g wireless slowly  carefully taking shape
