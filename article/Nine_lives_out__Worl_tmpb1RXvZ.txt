new york   corduroy  who was declared as the world s oldest living cat by guinness  is feared to have died after the    year old feline went missing from his home in the us  the cat ran outside his home in sisters  oregon in early october and has not been seen since  his family says 
corduroy lived with entrepreneur ashley reed okura and her    year old husband aaron masusru okura  who owns a restaurant   it is with a heavy heart i make this post  announcing that corduroy has most likely crossed the rainbow bridge   owner reed okura wrote in an instagram post on thanksgiving 
 we miss him terribly and i hold out hope he will return    logically  corduroy won t come home  i appreciate all the support and love corduroy has received he was an exceptional sir  i am grateful we had an unbelievable  special     years together   reed okura wrote 
she chose corduroy  who was a half main coon cat  during a visit to a shelter in a neighbouring town when she was just six years old  the new york daily reported  corduroy became the world s oldest cat  according to guinness  when    year old scooter passed away earlier this year in texas  corduroy had actually been named the world s oldest cat before scooter s existence was known  according to guinness  corduroy was born on august         
the family has owned corduroy since he was a kitten and when ashley was    the beloved corduroy has his own instagram page with more than        followers  his owner disclosed last year why corduroy was able to purr for so long  reed okura said the secret to her pet s longevity was the time he spends outdoors   although she had started supervising him on walks because of eagles and coyote   i think letting him roam the property and catch critters and get exercise has kept him really young looking   ashley said 
she believed he knew he was special because he enjoyed the attention he got from friends and family  and was patient with young visitors 
according to the daily mail   a  siamese cat recently cited by the guinness book of world records as the world s oldest living cat did not live to enjoy the title   scooter  the cat marked his   th birthday on    march and died less than a week after
