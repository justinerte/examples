the victims      some as young as         were found    throughout the entire square footage    of the warehouse 
a fire ripped through a warehouse in oakland on friday night  killing more than    people who were there for an electronic music concert  here are the names of people who have been confirmed dead by the alameda county sheriff       s office coroner       s bureau or immediate family members 
cash askew of oakland played guitar in a goth pop duo called them are us too  which released its first record last year and had been on tour recently  nbsp 
askew       s girlfriend  anya taylor  called her a        megamaster of electronic music        and wept over the phone as she spoke of askew  nbsp 
taylor  an oakland musician and performance artist  met askew a year ago at a concert  and the two bonded over their love of music  nbsp 
       we seemed to live these parallel lives         taylor said         two bottles of nbsp trashy ros eacute  and drunkenly singing morrissey later  we just knew          we became instant family when we met        
askew was a transgender woman  and she and taylor shared a close knit community of artist friends  many of whom were at the warehouse  known as the        ghost ship         that night  for many people who        shared a queer identity         underground venues like the warehouse were places where they felt safe 
taylor called her girlfriend        the spirit of san francisco         nbsp 
       i need the world to know how incredible she was         taylor said through tears         i loved her more than anything in the world        
on friday night  taylor was at home while askew went to the party  taylor had planned to go but had to go to work the next morning and told askew to have fun and be safe  she didn       t hear from her but assumed        she was probably just having fun        
then taylor saw news about the fire online and rushed to the ghost ship  she stood outside the building for four hours 
       i watched the building burn  and i lost the love of my life         taylor said  her voice almost a whisper 
musician madigan shive first met askew when askew was about    years old  askew grew up surrounded by the bay area       s underground music scene  so it made sense that she became a part of it  shive said 
       everybody just saw this star  just saw this shooting star in her         she said 
askew       s record label  dais records  issued a statement praising her        gentle kindness  and her creative momentum        
       she was loved and admired by everyone she met  and her passing is an excruciating loss that we may never fully process or recover from         nbsp it read
