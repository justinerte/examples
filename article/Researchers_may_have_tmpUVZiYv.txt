researchers may have found first polluted river from before bronze age

in this now dry riverbed in the wadi faynan region of southern jordan  professor russell adams  from the department of anthropology at the university of waterloo  and his colleagues found evidence of early pollution caused by the combustion of copper  neolithic humans here may have been in the early stages of developing metallurgy by learning how to smelt 
the research findings  published in science of the total environment  shed light on a turning point in history  when humans began moving from making tools out of stones to making tools out of metal  this period  known as the chalcolithic or copper age  is a transitional period between the late neolithic or stone age and the beginning of the bronze age 
 these populations were experimenting with fire  experimenting with pottery and experimenting with copper ores  and all three of these components are part of the early production of copper metals from ores   said adams   the technological innovation and the spread of the adoption and use of metals in society mark the beginning of the modern world  
people created copper at this time by combining charcoal and the blue green copper ore found in abundance in this area in pottery crucibles or vessels and heating the mixture over a fire  the process was time consuming and labour intensive and  for this reason  it took thousands of years before copper became a central part of human societies 
many of the objects created in the earliest phase of copper production were primarily symbolic and fulfilled a social function within society  attaining rare and exotic items was a way in which individuals attained prestige 
as time passed  communities in the region grew larger and copper production expanded  people built mines  then large smelting furnaces and factories by about      bc 
 this region is home to the world s first industrial revolution   said adams   this really was the centre of innovative technology  
but people paid a heavy price for the increased metal production  slag  the waste product of smelting  remained  it contained metals such as copper  lead  zinc  cadmium  and even arsenic  mercury and thalium  plants absorbed these metals  people and animals such as goats and sheep ate them  and so the contaminants bioaccumulated in the environment  
adams believes the pollution from thousands of years of copper mining and production must have led to widespread health problems in ancient populations  infertility  malformations and premature death would have been some of the effects  researchers have found high levels of copper and lead in human bones dating back to the roman period  
human use of copper dating back to the bronze age has shaped the evolution of bacteria  leading to bugs that are highly resistant to the metal s antibacterial properties 
copper and cadmium exist naturally in the environment  but human activities including industrial and agricultural processes can increase their concentrations  at high concentrations  copper can cause unwanted health effects
