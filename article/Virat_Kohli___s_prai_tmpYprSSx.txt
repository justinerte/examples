teenaged england opener haseeb hameed rsquo s compact batting earned him the nickname  lsquo little boycott rsquo   high praise as the former england opener is regarded as one of the most technically accomplished batsmen in the game 
however  the idols of the    year old of indian origin are sachin tendulkar and virat kohli  as an eight year old  haseeb was thrilled to get his picture clicked with tendulkar at bandra rsquo s mig cricket club  and after the third test in mohali  which india won by eight wickets  he got the opportunity for a one on one with kohli  
though a fractured little finger in mohali has ruled him out of the last two tests  the bolton based batsman  whose family migrated from gujarat  is already seen as england rsquo s find of the tour  in mohali  he won everyone over by batting with the injury and scoring a gritty half century 
the picture of haseeb sitting with kohli outside the mohali dressing room  listening attentively to the india skipper  has gone viral  haseeb tweeted   ldquo this was a great moment for me as well  a really sincere and honest guy  grateful for his time  minutes after his side had won the game  rdquo 
haseeb couldn rsquo t sleep that night   ldquo haseeb is a big virat fan  to get an opportunity to play against him and then to have a    to    minutes conversation is a huge thing for him  rdquo  elder brother numan told ht  
what did kohli tell haseeb   ldquo we don rsquo t ask him too many questions  but he was very excited to share with us that virat told him he can be a star in all three formats  to have such an assurance from someone like virat is a big boost for haseeb  although haseeb has just started off  no player likes to get labelled that he is meant just for tests or t  s  rdquo  
kohli praised haseeb rsquo s gritty knock in mohali   ldquo he put his hand up when his team wanted him to  you can sense it as a captain  this guy is intelligent  he rsquo s a great prospect for england and he rsquo s definitely going to be a star in all forms if he keeps persisting with his skill  rdquo  
numan revealed haseeb wanted to open despite the injury but was sent at no    scoring    not out  
 ldquo the team management felt he would be better lower down the order as he plays spin well  that was a huge compliment for haseeb to achieve in his debut tour  playing the likes of r ashwin and ravindra jadeja is no mean task  rdquo  said numan  who has played club cricket in england  
with     runs in just three tests  haseeb is already seen as a worthy opening partner to skipper alastair cook 
haseeb rsquo s brother attributed the maturity to father ismail rsquo s struggles as a driving instructor in bolton  through which he supported his three sons to play cricket 
 ldquo there have been many financial setbacks but my father always urged us to look at the positives  haseeb has seen how we  brothers numan and safwan  struggled  all that experience and learning has made him stronger mentally  rdquo 
his family was disappointed when haseeb wasn rsquo t picked for the u    world cup in        ldquo it was a huge setback for haseeb  it was his dream to play the world cup  but since then he has worked tremendously hard on every opportunity that has come his way  who would have thought haseeb would debut for england in a year  rdquo
