physicists confirm the precision of magnetic fields in the most advanced stellarator in the world
http://phys.org/news/2016-12-physicists-precision-magnetic-fields-advanced.html
the findings  published in the november    issue of nature communications   revealed an error field   or deviation from the designed configuration   of less than one part in          such results could become a key step toward verifying the feasibility of stellarators as models for future fusion reactors  
w  x  for which pppl is the leading u s  collaborator  is the largest and most sophisticated stellarator in the world  built by the max planck institute for plasma physics in greifswald  it was completed in      as the vanguard of the stellarator design   other collaborators on the u s  team include doe s oak ridge and los alamos national laboratories  along with auburn university  the massachusetts institute of technology  the university of wisconsin madison and xanthos technologies 
 twisty magnetic fields
stellarators confine the hot  charged gas  otherwise known as plasma  that fuels fusion reactions in twisty   or   d   magnetic fields  compared with the symmetrical   or  d    fields that the more widely used tokamaks create  the twisty configuration enables stellarators to control the plasma with no need for the current that tokamaks must induce in the gas to complete the magnetic field   stellarator plasmas thus run little risk of disrupting  as can happen in tokamaks  causing the internal current to abruptly halt and fusion reactions to shut down  
pppl has played key roles in the w  x project  the laboratory designed and delivered five barn door sized trim coils that fine tune the stellarator s magnetic fields and made their measurement possible   we ve confirmed that the magnetic cage that we ve built works as designed   said lazerson  who led roughly half the experiments that validated the configuration of the field   this reflects u s  contributions to w  x   he added   and highlights pppl s ability to conduct international collaborations   support for this work comes from euratom and the doe office of science 
to measure the magnetic field  the scientists launched an electron beam along the field lines  they next obtained a cross section of the entire magnetic surface by using a fluorescent rod to intersect and sweep through the lines  thereby inducing fluorescent light in the shape of the surface 
remarkable fidelity
results showed a remarkable fidelity to the design of the highly complex magnetic field   to our knowledge   the authors write of the discrepancy of less than one part in           this is an unprecedented accuracy  both in terms of the as built engineering of a fusion device  as well as in the measurement of magnetic topology  
the w  x is the most recent version of the stellarator concept  which lyman spitzer  a princeton university astrophysicist and founder of pppl  originated during the     s  stellarators mostly gave way to tokamaks a decade later  since the doughnut shaped facilities are simpler to design and build and generally confine plasma better  but recent advances in plasma theory and computational power have led to renewed interest in stellarators
