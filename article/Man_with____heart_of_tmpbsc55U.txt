victor colon didn t show up for thanksgiving dinner with his family in kensington  so his sister traveled from central pennsylvania last weekend to drive the gritty streets of the philly neighborhood hoping to see her big brother 
instead  she saw an ambulance carry his body away 
 we were trying to reach out to him   said edna villafane   but i guess the drug beat us  
colon      was one of nine people who died from apparent drug overdoses in and around kensington over the weekend  authorities said monday 
they died less than three weeks after the city had    overdose cases in a single day 
the weekend s fatal ods happened in a    hour period from      a m  saturday to   p m  sunday  and most were in the   th police district  which covers parts of kensington  juniata park  and port richmond  said lt  john stanford  police spokesman 
at this rate  philadelphia is likely to reach     fatal drug overdoses this year  officials said  that would be more than triple the city s homicide rate 
until the medical examiner s office officially rules on causes of death for the nine people who died this weekend  the cases are being handled as sudden death investigations  although stanford said they all appear to be  related to narcotics use  
he said the department would not release the names of the victims  but police said they ranged in age from    to    and included both men and women 
five of the victims were found inside houses  two were found in parked vehicles  and two were found outside  police said 
villafane said her brother  who lived with her mother in kensington  was found in the bathroom of an acquaintance s house 
 he s been wandering around because of the shame he was carrying   she said   he asked a neighbor if he could use the bathroom  and they let him in and that was that  
villafane said her brother had a  heart of gold  and  was the best uncle   although he didn t have children of his own  he enjoyed coaching little league baseball and other sports  he recently had lost his job in retail  his sister said 
 victor colon      was among the nine people who died of drug overdose related deaths in philadelphia over the weekend  credit  facebook
earlier this year  colon underwent major surgery for a knee infection and was prescribed prescription pain pills  which is how his family believes he may have become addicted to heroin  villafane said 
 that s what we re thinking  because we didn t expect any of this   she said 
jose benitez  executive director of prevention point philadelphia  a nonprofit agency that provides needle exchange and other health services to drug addicts  said the city typically has three overdoses a day  not all fatal 
benitez said    overdoses were reported throughout the city nov      five of which were fatal  he said fentanyl laced heroin is believed to have caused those overdoses and may have led to the latest ones as well 
on nov      the day after the overdose spike  prevention point handed out    kits containing the opioid antidote naloxone  up from the usual four or five kits the agency gives out in a day  benitez said 
according to an alert from the philadelphia department of public health  the nov     overdoses may have been associated with heroin batches labeled  indian creek    knock out         quality    swine flu   and  scum bag  
stanford said police would investigate any possible connection between the nov     overdoses and those that occurred last weekend

roland lamb  deputy commissioner for planning and innovation in the city s department of behavioral health and intellectual disability services  said he had not seen anything like the recent spikes in overdoses since the      fentanyl crisis 
 and this is going to eclipse that  i think   he said 
lamb could not immediately provide statistics on the deadliest overdose weekends in recent philadelphia history 
 i don t know for sure  but i m really concerned by what we re hearing now   he said   i m very concerned  
according to jeff moran  spokesman for the medical examiner s office  about a month ago officials projected that the city would have     drug overdose deaths in      
now  he said  the city likely will reach     fatal overdoses this year  if so  it would represent a    percent increase in overdose fatalities over last year 
when first responders encounter a spate of overdose deaths  generally the immediate suspicion is that a more potent drug has hit the streets  although that may not be readily apparent from blood tests  said jeanmarie perrone  an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania 
that is partly because some hospital labs may not be equipped to detect certain emerging opioids and also because the amounts of the drug in a user s system are so minute  she said 
in such cases  heroin may have been mixed with  or even entirely replaced by  any of several emerging opioids that are up to       times more potent  said perrone  who also volunteers at prevention point 
the alternative opioids include fentanyl and its derivatives  and other imported substances that fall under the umbrella of  research chemicals   perrone said 
spreading the word about new  dangerous opioids is tricky because users may be more tempted to try them  said perrone  who is also a professor at penn s perelman school of medicine 
 it s a little bit of a double edged sword   she said   that s the scary part  that really makes the public health surveillance and the warnings about this very challenging  
kensington the  epicenter 
in a statement released monday about the overdose deaths  mayor kenney called kensington the  epicenter of the city s opioid use  and said it was  almost certain  the city would see a  significant increase in drug overdose deaths this year  
according to stanford  police officers were able to save four people in the   th district with naloxone over the weekend 
but there is no antidote for the pain experienced by those who lose loved ones to drug overdoses 
 it s just this heroin  this heroin  it s killing people slowly   villafane said   i don t think the meaning of brotherly love is here anymore
