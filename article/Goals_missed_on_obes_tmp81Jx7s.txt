progress in the u s  against obesity  food poisoning  and infections spread in hospitals has been uneven and disappointing  despite dedicated efforts to fight these health threats by the nation s top public health agency 
the centers for disease control and prevention issued a frank self assessment monday of its campaign to focus on certain health problems  an effort it called  quot winnable battles  quot  while there have been clear successes in areas like smoking and teen pregnancy  other areas have seen little change or even gotten worse 
particularly disappointing is the battle against childhood obesity  said dr  tom frieden  the cdc s director 
 quot the data speak for themselves  quot  frieden said of the obesity statistics   quot if you look for the goal we set for ourselves  and look at what happened  we didn t achieve it  quot 
frieden set a list of priorities he called  quot winnable battles quot  shortly after he was named to lead the cdc in       the list included smoking  aids  obesity and nutrition  teen pregnancy  auto injuries and health care infections  it later grew to include food poisoning 
on monday  the agency released what it described as its third and final nbsp report nbsp card on the campaign  frieden is expected to leave office next month  as the trump administration takes control of federal agencies and appoints its own administrators 
the most clear cut progress was in cigarette smoking and teen pregnancy  last year  national goals were met for reducing adult smoking by more than    percent  and youth smoking by    percent  the goal of cutting the teen birth rate by    percent was also met 
critics argued that those were relatively easy goals     smoking and teen pregnancy rates were already trending down before frieden arrived  but frieden argued that the goals his agency set were ambitious and never assured 
another goal once considered within easy reach was the reduction of car crash deaths by    percent by       earlier in this decade those deaths were plummeting and the goal seemed well within reach  but crash deaths only fell    percent because of a recent uptick  which many attribute to distracted driving 
the report card also found 
   disappointing results in meeting two food safety goals  rates of illness from harmful e  coli bacteria dropped  but didn t reach the goal of a    percent reduction goal  and illness rates from salmonella increased 
   mixed progress on cutting down infections spread in hospitals and medical clinics  three kinds of infections declined  but not to target levels  and rates for certain urinary tract infections didn t fall at all 
   inability reduce the number of new hiv cases by    percent  the number of new cases fell by    percent 
   failure to reduce obesity rates for toddlers and older children  instead  the rate grew slightly  to more than    percent 
despite the mixed grades in the cdc s report card on itself  some experts applauded cdc efforts  saying the agency had only limited abilities to prevent illness or stop people from doing things that hurt their own health 
 quot i think  to cdc s credit  they picked a broad range of public health challenges and they set the bar high enough that they could not automatically declare success at the end of an administration  quot  said jeff levi  a george washington university professor of health management and policy 
the atlanta based cdc has an annual budget of more than     billion and a staff of more than         much of its funding is distributed to state and local health departments  and many of them follow the cdc s agenda setting lead
