geneva  sepp blatter lost his appeal against a six year ban by fifa on monday  and now has more serious legal cases lined up against him 
blatter said in a statement it was  difficult  to accept the court of arbitration for sport s verdict  but that  the way the case progressed  no other verdict could be expected  
the former fifa president  who was banned for approving a    million payment to michel platini in       said he will accept the decision  he could have pursued a further appeal at switzerland s supreme court 
 i have experienced much in my    years in fifa  i mostly learned that you can win in sport  but you can also lose   blatter said   nevertheless i look back with gratitude to all the years  in which i was able to realize my ideals for football and serve fifa  
the verdict ends blatter s hopes of becoming honorary president of the football body he left in disgrace in february  he must also pay fifa a fine of        swiss francs           
still  his legal problems are far from over 
blatter faces a separate fifa ethics investigation into suspected bribery linked to multi million dollar bonuses in top executives  contracts  swiss prosecutors also opened criminal proceedings against blatter for the platini payment  and a sale of world cup television rights 
he is also a stated target of american federal prosecutors in their sprawling investigation of corruption linked to international football officials  and an expected witness in a separate swiss probe of german organizers of the      world cup 
blatter denies any wrongdoing 
the three member cas panel was judging whether blatter was guilty of unethically offering a cash gift and conflict of interest with platini  who was a fifa vice president in      
blatter and platini both said the    million was uncontracted salary based on a verbal agreement more than a decade earlier  from      to       the former france great was the newly elected blatter s presidential adviser 
 the payment amounted to an undue gift as it had no contractual basis   cas said in a statement 
blatter said monday it was  incomprehensible  that his version was not accepted  in spite of my testimony to the contrary and the testimony given by other witnesses 
however  that explanation of a salary deal has now been doubted by three sets of judges at fifa and cas 
the fifa ethics committee investigated after the payment emerged in september      during the wider swiss federal probe of fifa 
blatter and platini     whose fifa presidential bid was stalled  then ended  by the case     were banned from football duty for eight years last december  the fifa appeal committee cut two years from both men s bans as  appropriate recognition  for their long service 
after a separate cas appeal hearing  platini s ban was reduced in may to four years  ensuring he lost the uefa presidency 
when blatter s case came to cas in august  platini testified on his behalf during a    hour hearing 
it might not be the last court room blatter sees 
blatter is suspected of bribery in a fifa ethics case that was opened in september  it also implicates former secretary general jerome valcke and former finance director markus kattner  who were both fired by fifa this year 
the latest ethics investigation relates to alleged self dealing in fifa employment contracts that promised blatter tens of millions of dollars in bonuses for each successful world cup and completing a four year mandate 
the fifa ethics committee and cas have insisted on life bans in previous bribery cases 
fifa has not filed a criminal complaint over the bonus payments  the zurich based football body said monday 
also seesepp blatter ban  former fifa president to learn fate on monday after cas verdict
switzerland s attorney general has opened criminal proceedings against blatter for suspected financial mismanagement and embezzlement in the platini payment  plus fifa awarding world cup television rights to the caribbean in      that seemed undervalued by at least     million 
swiss prosecutors have also opened a case against franz beckenbauer and other      world cup organizers over a suspicious payment of     million euros     million  through fifa s accounts in       blatter s former right hand man urs linsi was formally made a suspect last month 
united states federal investigators have said blatter is a target in their probe of bribery  wire fraud and money laundering in international football 
several former fifa vice presidents are among more than    football and marketing officials either indicted or who have made guilty pleas in a case that mostly involves commercial rights to non fifa tournaments and world cup qualifying games in latin america 
however  blatter could be a significant witness to explain suspected bribe payments totaling     million through fifa accounts in       u s  prosecutors said the money was to settle bribes for three fifa voters  including american official chuck blazer  who supported south africa s successful bid to host the      world cup 
the cases are expected to develop in the first half of      
blatter has acknowledged being advised by lawyers not to travel from switzerland  which does not extradite its own citizens 
his last known trip abroad was to russia in july      to join vladimir putin on stage for the world cup qualifying draw at a former royal palace in st  petersburg
