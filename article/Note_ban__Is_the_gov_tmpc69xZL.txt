it has taken three weeks for the governor of the central bank of the world s fastest growing major economy to break a silence on a grand plan to suck out more than    percent of cash floating in the system in a nation of more than one billion people 
was there a grand plan behind the reticence  it would seem not 
reserve bank of india governor urjit patel s reluctance to speak out  and then a measured assurance that  genuine  pains shall be addressed after a controversial move that has frozen parliament on its tracks smack of an ad hoc approach the narendra modi government seems to be adopting in the wake of its   november decision to demonetise rs     and       notes 
there has been one response speech decision everyday in the past couple of weeks on an average to mitigate pains or explain the actions  while news  tweets  tv visuals and jokes bring stories of pain and outrage from across the economy 
critics may call these responses as one of knee jerk reactions or firefighting after a social uproar but the government seems to be confident at best and brazen at worst as it moves ahead with a crackdown on black money  never mind the fact that a legitimate cash economy of street vendors  farmers and landless rural workers are umbilically tied up with the black bathwater that the government wants to throw out 
the broadly accepted reasoning to justify the ad hoc approach is that there was a need for stealth to prevent money laundering or other steps that might let the big fish escape the black money dragnet  on the other hand  there is every reason to believe that once the cat was out of the bag to catch the black mice in question  the government has been more reactive than pro active  is the government tying itself into knots on the issue  is there a better way of doing things than those involving contorted jalebi like measures that are not exactly sweet  is jalebinomics the accompanying ideological framework to a commando like  surgical strike  on the black economy 
it seems the government is happy at the mere fact that it is aiming in the right direction  and good intent justifies the means and methods it is pursuing  but consider the measures implemented so far and it seems there was no plan at all  not to speak of plans a  b and c any modern administration would have for such a gargantuan task 
one day the government announces it will use indelible ink to prevent proxy crowding of banks by those aiming to turn black money into white  another day it announces easing of the use of demonetised currency by farmers to buy fertilisers  on a third day it stops the long queues on its tracks and says   sorry but you have to deposit money  and you can t be just exchanging your old cash for new   and then the prime minister bats for a cashless digital economy and jan dhan yojana takes centrestage  almost as if the mission was less about catching the black sharks and more about going millennial in money matters 
suddenly  in a swift weekend coup  the rbi announces that the the bulk of the piles of cash that commercial banks are sucking in under the demonetisation will be further transported to the central bank through its cash reserve ratio  crr  mechanism  sending the bond markets into a tizzy  even as global agencies down rate india s gdp growth 
it dawns on us now  what is happening is a simple exercise of old fashioned power  the government seems to think  rightly or wrongly  that once a big stick is wielded  the carrots can come slow  you could call it the arrival of  daroga capitalism  in india 
also seeurjit patel breaks silence on demonetisation  says rbi monitoring situation daily
darogas are an integral part of india s public memory  the mirriam webster dictionary calls the term as one representing a  chief officer  especially   the head of a police  customs  or excise station  the word of persian origin has a strong political flavour and cultural connect in india since the mughal times 
the daroga can be good or bad  but socially  darogas are usually feared and respected and often avoided  the daroga can mean well but is usually suspicious and extremely aware of the potential of his powers 
the government seems to be behaving like one  this guilty until proven innocent kind of approach to catching tax evaders is one that certainly has fans among those who believe in the law and order school of economics but the problem is that shoals of small fish have been haplessly caught in a net cast wide to catch the big ones 
and there are other nagging questions  can you cast a net to catch whales  or worse  are there black money sharks out there who can bite their way out of the net 
as a half hearted  bharat bandh   ironically  cause more inconvenience to the already inconvenienced masses of the cash economy  the only hope for india s economy is that the gains of jalebinomics and daroga capitalism will far outstrip the evident pains
