kim kardashian and kanye west have had an emotional year  first  kim is robbed of some of her most prized possessions as well as her sense of safety in paris  and  then  kanye is hospitalized right before thanksgiving for exhaustion  now that kanye is at home recovering with his family  it should come as no surprise that the pair is  xa    x   c taking the rest of      off   x   d  according to page six 
what this means exactly is unclear  kim has been on a hiatus from her social media profiles since the scary robbery  so it  x     s likely that silence will continue  kanye has already cancelled his tour   xa  page six says    x   c  w e hear they  x     re planning to call off the rest of their engagements until      to spend time with kids  north and saint   x   d 
kanye has been very vocal about how much  xa  he loves his family  during an interview with e  news  when kim  xa  asked kanye remotely how much he missed her and the kids  kanye replied    x   c more than anything   x   d  he also said in that same interview that her spirit is always with him  lt   
and do you remember that video kanye made for kim for her birthday earlier this year  we actually cried 
we hope some good quality time with the family helps them heal  we  x     re sending good vibes their way
