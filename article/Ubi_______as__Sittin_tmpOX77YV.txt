helen ubi ntilde as is an award winning columnist at the daily news  she is  a champion of the little guy  or gal   especially those philly residents who go unseen and unheard  and a not so easily plucked thorn in the side of city politicians and organizations who forget they serve the public 
i am hugging a trump supporter 
yeah  i didn t see that coming  either 
see  i m an unapologetic and unrelenting critic of the presidential disaster elect  his supporters  in turn  are frequent and enthusiastic contributors to the trash heap that is my inbox  voice mail  twitter timeline  and comment sections since donald trump s election 
in many ways     year old miriam courtney s email in response to a recent column about trump was more of the same 
 quot you re such a cynic  quot 
 quot you are the one spewing hate  quot 
 quot you are so  brain washed  quot 
she signed it   quot a latina who proudly voted for trump  quot 
it would have been easy to add courtney s email to my ever growing pile of correspondence  but in the middle of courtney s note was something that stopped me  that spoke to that wave of anger that trump supposedly rode into the white house 
on march           courtney wrote  her grandson died of a drug overdose  and no one cared 
 quot not one word was mentioned 
 quot the city failed him 
 quot the state failed him 
 quot the country failed him  quot 
between exclamation points and talking points what i heard was a grandmother from northeast philadelphia who was angry how her grandson died  and how her grief has gone unacknowledged 
i called and asked if i could stop by her somerton home 
she s a different person face to face than she is on email 
there was a lot about trump that reached into her and her pain  courtney told me when we sat down to chat in her cozy kitchen  she liked his stance on illegal immigration  she and her family came to the united states from colombia  sponsored by relatives  legally  she stressed 
but nothing resonated more than when trump talked about building a wall between the u s  and mexico to keep out criminals and drugs 
her first grandchild  nicholas perry  was    when he was found slumped on a bridge at b and somerset streets  he was alone  someone had stolen all of his belongings except the phone clutched in his hand 
he d struggled with addiction  but his sudden death was no less shocking to his close knit family 
while his mother worked  courtney cared for him while when he was a little boy  when he was seriously injured in a hit and run accident in      and couldn t maneuver the steps in his mother s house  courtney brought him to her home to recuperate in a first floor bedroom  she carefully administered his pain meds 
on the way out of the room  she points to the nicks on the door frame from his wheelchair 
 quot i don t even want to paint it  quot  she says  choking up   quot i m going to have to  i have to let it go  quot 
after nicholas  death  she went back to the spot where he overdosed and burned sage  she also wrote to many public officials  pleading with them to do more about the drugs that are leaving families like hers destroyed 
courtney is convinced trump   with tough  if vague  talk about law and order   is the guy to fix this  if the country had been tougher on crime and criminals  she insists  her grandson would still be alive 
during our talk  i have to stop myself on numerous occasions from debating her  i remind myself i am here to hear a grieving grandmother out 
after about an hour or so  i get up to leave  she thanks me for coming  and for letting her share her grandson s story 
she says she wishes more people on opposite sides could sit across a table and listen to each other  i agree 
at the end of our visit  i still believe trump is a threat to our country  and she still believes he might very well be its savior 
 quot give me a hug  quot  she says 
 quot i m hugging a trump supporter  quot  i joke 
she laughs   quot see  anything is possible  quot 
i tell her if i m wrong about trump  i ll be more than happy to come back and eat my words  i ll bring cake  i say  to make the crow go down a little easier 
 quot no  quot  she says   quot you know what you can bring me   a mojito  quot
