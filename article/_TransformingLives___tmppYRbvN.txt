a walk through dharavi     widely considered asia s  largest slum      gives you a sense of bustling bylanes and nooks  with its area undergoing several changes  just like every other part of mumbai  and the make in india campaign by prime minister narendra modi providing another impetus to the several small scale industries and workshops set up here  the residents are clearly looking forward to scaling up their brands and businesses 
but what about the gen next here 
children in dharavi go to schools in the surrounding areas  but a lot of them still opt for the education provided in the local bmc schools  our multimedia crew stumbled upon one such school     the c survey school in dharavi  also known as khadda school  the latter name was given to it by locals     a huge pit once existed in the vicinity 
this school is for primary students and has an attendance of around     children on average  the number of enrolled students however  is      one starts to wonder  why the discrepancy  one also starts to wonder  what the environment where a child is taught is supposed to look like  given that the school is in the heart of the slums  
on a visit to the school  we found out that the walls were drab  the paint peeling off  the rooms  painted in dark colours looked dingy and small  surely  this wasn t the best environment to induce young minds to learn 
nerolac  in association with firstpost  decided to change things and launched  transforminglives  as part of this initiative  we got an artist from goa called shallu sharma and asked her to redesign the interiors of this school in dharavi  this slice of life  documentary is the story of that journey  the smiles on the kids  faces and the reactions from the locals were a treat  but what really made us feel like we had achieved something was the fact that more students began to attend school regularly  it went up to its full capacity and the teachers couldn   t rejoice any more than we did 
watch this short video on the amazing transformation a little paint and a whole lot of creativity could achieve
