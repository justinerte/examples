philadelphia     damaging testimony that bill cosby gave in an accuser   s lawsuit  including admissions that he gave young women drugs and alcohol before sex  can be used at his sex assault trial  a judge ruled monday 
the defense has insisted cosby testified only after being promised he would never be charged over his      encounter with accuser andrea constand  but his lawyers at the time never had an immunity agreement or put anything in writing 
    this court concludes that there was neither an agreement nor a promise not to prosecute  only an exercise of prosecutorial discretion     montgomery county judge steven o   neill wrote in his ruling 
cosby      acknowledged in the      deposition that he had a string of extramarital relationships  he called them consensual  but many of the women say they were drugged and molested  cosby  questioned about the      encounter at his home with constand  described being on his couch and putting his hand down her pants 
    i don   t hear her say anything  and i don   t feel her say anything  and so i continue and i go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection  i am not stopped     he said in his testimony 
prosecutors describe constand as being semiconscious after cosby gave her three unmarked blue pills for stress that night  the release of the deposition testimony last year prompted them to reopen her      police complaint and arrest cosby days before the statute of limitations expired  o   neill has vowed to try the case by june 
the ruling on the deposition is one of two key pretrial issues that will determine the scope of the evidence against cosby  the other question is how many other accusers will be allowed to testify in prosecutors    attempt to show a pattern of similar conduct  prosecutors hope to call    additional women who say they were assaulted by cosby as far back as the     s  two days of arguments on that issue are set for next week 
at a pretrial hearing earlier this year  o   neill said that cosby   s decision to testify at the deposition could have been strategic  the actor     known as america   s dad for his top rated family sitcom     the cosby show     which ran from      to          could have invoked his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself  but jurors would have heard of that decision if the case went to trial 
cosby instead settled constand   s lawsuit  for an undisclosed amount  after finishing four days of testimony about his extramarital affairs  his friendship with constand and other topics 
in another excerpt  cosby described a phone call with constand   s mother a year later  when he refused to say what the pills were 
    i   m not going to argue with somebody   s mother who is accusing me of something     he testified     and i   m apologizing because i   m thinking this is a dirty old man with a young girl  i apologized  i said to the mother it was digital penetration    
cosby also described getting seven prescriptions for quaaludes in the     s  which he said he kept on hand to give women he hoped to seduce     the same as a person would say     have a drink       
constand had met cosby at temple university when she managed the women   s basketball team  he was a prominent booster and university trustee  she went to police in      to report that he had sexually assaulted her a year earlier after taking what cosby described as an herbal product  constand  then     was dating a woman at the time and had no romantic interest in the    year old cosby  her lawyer has said 
district attorney kevin steele called the ruling on the deposition an important development in the    year old case 
    allowing the jury to hear mr  cosby   s deposition testimony is another step forward in this case and will aid the jury in making its determination  it   s important that we are able to present all of the evidence available     steele said 
defense lawyer brian mcmonagle had no comment on the decision 
the defense will fight strenuously to block the testimony of the other women  arguing that their accounts are vague  decades old and impossible to defend  cosby   s lawyers had hoped to question the women in person to assess their credibility and relevance  but o   neill rejected the idea 
defense lawyers also say cosby is legally blind and can no longer recognize his accusers or help his legal team prepare for trial 
constand      is now a massage therapist in her native ontario  she signed off on the decision by prosecutors to reopen the case  the associated press does not typically name people who say they are sexual assault victims  but constand has given permission for her name to be used
