roughly a month has passed since the narendra modi led nda government demonetised high value notes to flush out black money held in cash  among other objectives  this move sought to weaken the political opposition ahead of elections in uttar pradesh and punjab and bolster the ruling party rsquo s chances in the national elections in       but this process entails significant collateral damage to india rsquo s economic growth  this is no short term disruption holding out the promise of potential gain  the prospect is of the world rsquo s fastest growing emerging economy faltering in its stride  
what is the likely impact on india rsquo s output of goods and services or gdp growth  economists often head where angels fear to tread to quantify the unquantifiable and put out a precise number that a     percentage points decline is likely due to demonetisation  in other words  if the economy has been expanding by       the prospect is for it to slow down to      or worse to        ldquo economists are talking nonsense on gdp decline rdquo   thundered the md of hdfc bank  
many economists  however  are sensible enough in stating that the data are not fully in to estimate the third quarter rsquo s gdp growth or make an informed assessment

india rsquo s economic fundamentals  however  remain weak  the stock markets are tanking on adverse global and domestic cues  after registering a pace of      in april june  growth in the nation rsquo s gdp edged up marginally to      in july september       the shock to the cash economy is bound to be felt in the subsequent quarters as consumer spending is subdued and footfalls fade in shopping malls  brick and mortar retail trade is seriously stressed  trucks are idling  the farmers need to be paid for the crops that have been harvested  cash is urgently needed for seeds and fertilisers for the next season 
as if all of this weren rsquo t bad enough  investment of the private sector continues to be extremely sluggish  spending on plant and machinery in gdp is in fact declining  
according to pronab sen  former chief statistician  the ongoing cash crunch has perhaps permanently damaged the informal sector that accounts for     of gdp and     of employment  with a sharp decline in manufacturing  north block itself has suggested that overall growth in the september  december      quarter will be lower by two percentage points to      from      in september december

if this scenario comes to pass  demonetisation would hit this year rsquo s growth target of   to        for starters  economic growth in the january to march      quarter would have to be much faster by      or       to attain that objective  both of which are most unlikely  there is no doubt a lot of uncertainty when the cash economy gets going again  
printing an equivalent amount of notes that were taken out of circulation is likely to take at least six months or more even assuming the printing presses work to capacity  in this period  the shortage of cash casts a baleful shadow over the indian economy rsquo s growth
