president obama   s former national security adviser said monday that president elect donald trump   s phone call with the president of taiwan should not be seen as a big deal 
offering his perspective in an interview with fox news  retired marine corps general jim jones said     that didn t bother me  i think the purists are flapping their wings and saying all kinds of things  why they can t have a five minute conversation or whatever it was to say congratulations doesn t make a lot of sense to me    
    i think the trump administration will have to find whatever the right course is  and the right things during their administration  but i wouldn t prejudge what that would be right now     jones said     he s not the president of the united states right now  he s the president  elect  he s talking to a lot of people around the world and that s not necessarily a bad thing    
 trump is the first president or president elect to speak with a taiwanese leader since the united states broke off relations with taiwan in      under president jimmy carter  when his administration established formal relations with beijing  marking the start of the one china policy    
    i think the policy is fine     jones said     i think we should lighten up a little bit about the importance of phone calls and signals that may or may not have been sent  i think policy is pretty stable and the chinese relationship is very important    
 for the first time  china sent a pair of bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons to circle taiwan  two us officials tell fox news  the incident occurred november     less than a week before trump s controversial call friday with the president of taiwan  tsai ing wen  angering chinese leaders who lodged a diplomatic protest the next day 
 japan scrambled eight f    fighter jets to intercept the two chinese h  k bombers and their two escort planes at one point northeast of taiwan  according to officials 
 trump s response to critics of his phone call came in a tweet friday 
  quot interesting how the u s  sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call  quot 
 u s  arms sales to taiwan have totaled more than     billion since       in december       the united states  under president obama  announced a       billion arms sales agreement with taiwan  the first arms sale in four years 
 critics were outraged that trump had broken decades long policy by speaking with taiwan   s president  when asked on cbs   s    face the nation    sunday if he thought trump was speaking to the leader of a sovereign nation  trump   s future chief of staff  reince priebus  said     he knew exactly what was happening  but look  we have a lot of problems to solve in this country  and we   re not going to solve them by just making believe that people don   t exist  this is not a massive deviation of our policy    
 since the chinese civil war in the     s  china and taiwan have been ruled separately  china claims sovereignty over the island 
 the white house was on the defensive monday  white house press secretary josh earnest said officials had already made at least two calls to the chinese 
    i can confirm that u s  officials  including senior officials on the national security council  been in touch with their chinese counterparts to reiterate our country   s continued commitment to one china policy     he said 
 trade tariffs are another point of friction  china imposes a    percent tariff on imported cars  for instance  while the united states has either eliminated tariffs or charges two and a half percent or less for overseas products   a huge advantage for china 
 the flight around taiwan consisted of two chinese xian h  k bombers  along with two escort planes  a tupolev tu     and shaanxi y    flying around the island of taiwan from mainland china  taking off and landing from two separate chinese military bases 
 the escort jets were used to collect radar information and conduct other surveillance on american allies such as japan  fox news was told  the chinese bombers stayed in international airspace  according to officials 
 at different points of the flight  chinese j    and su    fighter jets performed escort duties for the chinese strategic bombers 
  quot china has steadily built up a massive military capability in the area around taiwan  this isn t simply a matter of flying bombers  understand that technically  we can t object to flying bombers near taiwan if we are flying combat aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft near china  this is simply legal under international law  quot  said anthony h  cordesman  the arleigh a  burke chair in strategy at the center for strategic and international studies 
 quot taiwan faces a much more serious chinese challenge than it has ever faced before  quot
