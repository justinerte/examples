 oakland  calif      for the artists who lived in the rickety  debris filled warehouse called    the ghost ship     what lured them was the promise of beauty and art  what they saw this weekend instead was death and reality in its most brutal and tragic form 
the step by step search after friday inferno     so far turning up    bodies     has covered    percent of the building   s charred hulk  said alameda county sheriff   s deputy tya modeste on tuesday 
crews now hope to buttress the remaining portion of the site  which has been too unstable to enter  authorities warn the death toll could rise as the last corners are combed 
on monday  survivors  former tenants and family members desperately waited for news and gave vivid accounts of the eclectic community that sprang up within the building   s fragile walls 
some were mournful  even wistful about the bohemian life they found in the large two story warehouse  they described it as a nourishing space where creativity thrived and a refuge in a city where ever rising housing prices were constantly chasing artists away 
others were scathing and recalled conditions ripe for disaster 
   it   s a death trap waiting to happen     said shelley mack  a jewelry maker who used to live at the ghost ship  paying      a month for rent 
 
the unstable structure was deemed unsafe for much of monday  prompting fire officials to pull back workers who had been haltingly trying to excavate the burned remains of those who came to a music party at the warehouse  investigators had identified    of the dead  including three victims from finland  south korea and guatemala  and had conducted autopsies on    
 
at a news conference monday afternoon  alameda county district attorney nancy o   malley said that charges of murder or involuntary manslaughter were possible  although she noted that a criminal investigation was in its early stages  federal investigators from the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives are assisting 
 
 
 
 
 
the warehouse was not licensed for dwellings or event space  and city authorities had recently sent an inspector after neighbors and others complained about trash outside and conditions inside 
 
what mack discovered when she moved into the ghost ship was stark  there were no sprinklers or fire alarms in the building  she said  propane tanks  located underneath a sink and in a hallway outside the bathroom  were used to provide hot water  transformers could be found in several places  she said  and people were constantly tripping over the wires and cords that ran throughout the space  a transformer exploded a couple of months after she moved in 
the building often had no electricity  said mack  who recalled often using a small flashlight on her keychain to get around  on the first floor were makeshift recreational vehicles where people lived  mack said her rv was at the back part of the building  a rickety  makeshift staircase made of wooden pallets led to the second floor  which was used for events 
   it was like organized chaos     said mariah benavides  who used to babysit for derick ion almena  who leased the building  and his wife  micah allison  the couple and their three children were not at the warehouse during the blaze  because  some reports said  almena had rented out the space for the party  
   it was dark  there were nails coming from the ground  the staircase was totally unstable  there was so much stuff     benavides said     there were people living downstairs on the first level  almost like a makeshift rv park with campers randomly everywhere    
despite the conditions  many described finding meaning and even beauty in the chaos 
the community included tattoo artists  jewelry makers  painters  sculptors  and people who hand stitched outfits and handbags  in addition to its draw as a symbol of artistry  it also was frequently the home of concerts such as the one held  friday  night  when the fire began  and a sanctuary for many in oakland   s lgbt community 
nikki kelber  one of about    people who lived in the warehouse  said     it was one of the most amazing  beautiful spaces you could ever see    
   it was beautiful     said pete veilleux  who was friends with people who lived there     it was like an art gallery  but people lived there    
in pictures on the community   s website  oaklandghostship com  every nook and cranny seems crammed with eclectic objects     wood   by  s  antique furniture  wooden lofts  tapestries  pianos  organs  yards of bright textiles  persian rugs piled on the floors and other oddities 
in retrospect  those objects appear as kindling  and the rooms subdivided by wooden walls as a deadly labyrinth that partygoers and residents tried to navigate amid the smoke and the terror 
 
 
   the space was never meant to have people living there     said benavides  who had last visited the ghost ship in          they tried to create that  and they created it in a way that   s unsafe    
benavides said almena and allison would leave their children     then ages      and       for days at a time  because the warehouse didn   t have running water  the children sometimes showered and ate at the nearby house of a friend of benavides 
   i don   t feel like they were totally malicious or evil people     she said     they were selfish and arrogant    
in a facebook post soon after the fire  almena wrote     everything i worked so hard for is gone  blessed that my children and micah were at a hotel safe and sound           it   s as if i have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope           to be standing now in poverty of self worth    
the post  which was later deleted  drew criticism and anger from families of the dead and survivors of the fire  
   i can   t explain who i am anymore     almena told nbc news in an interview broadcast monday night     we   ve done everything that we possibly can afford to do     his wife added 
danielle boudreaux  an artist  hairdresser  and jewelry and handbag maker  said she had a falling out with almena a year and a half ago after she told him not to raise his children at the warehouse and convinced allison   s relatives that it was dangerous 
 
boudreaux said    stairway    was too generous a description for the steps leading to the second level where almena   s family lived  
   it only took two people on it at a time           when you stepped on it  it wobbled  and there were ropes holding it up  if you had three people on that  it was falling down     she said 
once the fire began  she said     there was no way you were getting out of that building  even if you knew about the back stairwell  even if you knew it could take you up to the roof  who knows if you could have had time to get out even then    
  jeffrey pine  a former rhode island attorney general who defended a nightclub owner who faced criminal charges for a fire that killed     people in that state in       said oakland investigators will have to determine what caused the fire  whether flammable materials were allowed inside the building  and whether there had been any code violations 
it   s unclear whether oakland officials  or the building   s owner  chor ng  were aware that the warehouse had been converted into a residential artists collective  or that concerts or parties were being held inside 
 
in the years since the recession  budgets for building code enforcement have fallen significantly in most cities  said elley klausbruckner  a san diego based fire and building code consultant     so there   s less budget to be able to police these types of facilities    
at a news conference  darin ranelletti  director of oakland   s planning and building department  said the last permitted use of the building was as a warehouse  so neither habitation nor a concert would have been legal 
the building had a long history of complaints  with some lodged as recently as last month 
al garcia  who owns a business across the street  said trash  pianos  crates  boards  statues and abandoned cars were piled up outside the building 
the planning and building department had previously investigated the warehouse after complaints about trash and blight outside the property and conditions inside 
the most recent such complaint occurred on nov      oakland   s mayor  libby schaaf  said     they also alleged there was illegal or unpermitted construction inside  and possible residential use    
she said the city sent an inspector to the building on nov     in response to the complaints  but the inspector couldn   t get into the building  so the investigation simply remained open
