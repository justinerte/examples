italian prime minister resigns in populist revolt - the washington post
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/far-right-candidate-concedes-in-austrias-presidential-vote/2016/12/04/12a91500-b8b6-11e6-939c-91749443c5e5_story.html
 brussels          europe   s embattled political establishment lost another round sunday in its effort  to thwart the anti elite movement  as italian prime minister matteo renzi resigned after voters rejected his constitutional reforms  but a center left presidential candidate in austria handily defeated his far right challenger 
the thorough rejection of renzi   s referendum to streamline lawmaking was a significant boost for the country   s surging populist  forces just weeks after donald trump prevailed in the united states  renzi   s loss also risks unleashing financial upheaval in europe   s third largest economy as italy   s weak banks struggle to contain the fallout 
a populist takeover of italy is still an uncertain prospect  since renzi   s center left democratic party remains in control of parliament and national elections do not have to be called until       but much will depend on the makeup of the next government and how anti immigrant  euroskeptic parties capitalize on their success 
  with    percent of ballots counted       percent of voters rejected the reform  a  drubbing that far outpaced opinion polls ahead of the referendum 
the lead opposition to renzi  the insurgent five star movement  ran a spirited campaign against the prime minister   s reforms  joining forces with an unlikely cross section of allies  including some in renzi   s own party  many establishment politicians also questioned whether the reforms truly made sense as the country contends with grim prospects for growth and a wave of migration from africa   some said the changes were poorly written and  by removing checks on the prime minister   s power  could actually enable populists should they ever win the country   s top job 
italy  which has had    governments in the past    years  is no stranger to political chaos  what comes next will depend partially on italian president sergio mattarella  who is charged with picking a new person to try to form a government  as well as with deciding whether to hold early elections  elections are a key demand from the five star movement  which is running a close second to renzi   s party in the polls 
there may also be economic consequences  with italy   s shaky banks teetering amid the uncertainty  the euro dropped     percent against the dollar in early asian trading following renzi   s resignation  but many financial analysts cautioned against panic 
in the wake of renzi   s resignation  italy   s mainstream political parties are likely to change voting laws to make it more difficult to rule without a wide coalition  diluting the possibility that an insurgent force could seize power in the next elections   that would be a further check against the five star movement  although it would also further entrench italy   s general political dysfunction 
renzi   s anti establishment opponents were trying to capitalize on a wave of skepticism about the ability of elites to deal with globalization and the long  painful effects of the economic crisis that started nearly a decade ago  trump   s victory last month cheered the five star movement  an insurgent anti euro force that has support on the left and the right 
   today the arrogance that   s remained in power these last years has lost     said luigi di maio  who is expected to be the party   s candidate for prime minister in the next election     so ends the era of shortcuts and tweets      
 
sunday   s votes in austria and italy   captured the extent to which europeans are as politically polarized as americans  split on issues including immigration and free trade 
the result was an unexpectedly clear victory for austria   s beleaguered political establishment     one suggesting that the aggressive tactics and trump style campaign deployed by the austrian far right may have hurt more than they helped 
sunday   s election  in fact  was a rerun of one in may in which hofer lost by        votes  a result he successfully contested  his defeat on sunday by a far larger margin  observers said  may suggest european voters    unease with the comparisons of their politicians to trump  it also seemed to rob the momentum from far right leaders in france and the netherlands who have called trump   s victory part of a new    world order    they hope to join in elections next year 
following hofer   s concession  he and van der bellen exchanged a long handshake for photographers in the vienna studios of austrian state broadcaster orf  van der bellen credited his victory to a    broad movement    backing    freedom  equality and solidarity     his campaign manager  lothar lockl  saw the margin as evidence of a push against the nationalist tide by moderates 
   a movement could be evolving here  which is not only for austria  but can also bring about a change of attitude in the whole of europe     he said 
 
the race for the president   s ceremonial role held   high stakes  the position is constitutionally ambiguous  yet hofer  who has decried muslim immigration and free trade  vowed to beef it up     setting up a clash with the center left government and the european union  freedom party supporters on sunday had hoped for a    trump bump        but it bumped the wrong way 
   the trump bump could always go either way     said reinhard heinisch  a political scientist at the university of salzburg     the fact is  trump is not very popular in austria    
on sunday  austria   s domestic intelligence service launched an investigation into a mass text message that stated that only hofer voters should show up because polling stations were overcrowded  van der bellen supporters  the text said  should instead vote monday     although polls would be closed by then  according to the austrian daily der standard 
the race was perhaps more important as a bellwether of post trump voter trends in europe  where nationalists are poised to stage potent      campaigns in france  germany and the netherlands  a hofer victory would have potentially signaled the new electability of the far right  indeed  the freedom party sought to leverage hofer   s guy next door demeanor that seemed to take the bite out of his harshest condemnations  such as that    islam is not part of austria    
still  while portraying himself as the face of a reformed far right  he persisted in courting a more extreme base  for instance  he wore a cornflower lapel pin     a symbol of german nationalism also used by the nazis  hofer on sunday called for national unity following his defeat  yet within his party  the attacks were already flying  the freedom party   s powerful chairman  heinz christian strache  accused hofer   s opponents of running a    massive fear campaign     saying green party supporters of van der bellen had painted hofer as    a nazi
