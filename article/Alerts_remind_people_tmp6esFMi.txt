calls or texts from pharmacies before major storms help prompt people to stock up on their medications  according to a new study 
people who received a call or text before a major blizzard struck the northeastern united states in january      were   percent more likely than those who didn t receive a reminder to refill medications before travel became hazardous  researchers found 
 quot at a time when there is increased risk due to a natural disaster  how do you identify those people most at risk and get them the medications they need to stay at home  quot  said senior author dr  william shrank  of the university of pittsburgh medical center 
the study  published in jama internal medicine  was a collaboration between the u s  department of health and human services  hhs  and cvs health  where shrank served as chief scientific officer 
with a blizzard expected to hit the mid atlantic states in two days  cvs health started to call or send text message reminders to about      million customers in maryland  virginia  west virginia  kentucky and washington  d c 
the people were taking long term medications for conditions like mood disorders  heart disease and allergies 
the researchers  who included representatives from hhs and cvs health  then compared refills among people who were called and texted to about         who didn t receive reminders 
overall  they found     percent of people who received reminders refilled their medication within two days  compared to     percent of people in the comparison group 
shrank told reuters health that even without a reminder  many people plan to refill their medications when they hear on the news that a major storm is heading their way  but the new study shows that reminders add to awareness 
 quot there is an incremental benefit beyond what the media does by creating a partnership between the government and the private companies  quot  he said 
shrank hopes people recognize the urgency of these reminders and act on them 
 quot we re looking out for you because we know there is a potentially big storm coming  quot  he said 
hhs has been talking with most of the major pharmacy chains about scaling up this program  said lead author dr  nicole lurie of hhs 
 quot they have registered to receive the same data we provide to cvs  and we re optimistic that more of them will adopt this practice  quot  she told reuters health in an emailed statement   quot as  was  the case with cvs  we expect some will want to do some pilot tests before they go to scale  and we have offered to help  quot
