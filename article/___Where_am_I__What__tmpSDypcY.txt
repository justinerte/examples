amina hamawy burst into tears and then fainted when she returned to eastern aleppo to find that looters had ransacked her home   ldquo where am i  what happened  rdquo  she asked after her husband and daughter revived her   ldquo we have lost everything  rdquo 
they were among a few hundred residents who fled fighting in the hanano neighbourhood last month and were able to return after government forces drove out syrian rebels  whose besieged and bombed out enclave in eastern aleppo has begun to collapse 
after registering with authorities  hamawy rsquo s family was driven past blackened shells of buildings and mounds of rubble  devastation wrought by more than four years of near daily airstrikes  including explosives filled barrels dropped from helicopters 
their single story home was still intact  but the television  electrical cables and a large battery that supplied power for the home had been taken  either by retreating rebels  advancing forces or thieves exploiting the chaos 
the looters left the old refrigerator and the washing machine behind   ldquo if it had been a new  fully automatic one they would have stolen it  rdquo  said hamid malaji  hamawy rsquo s husband   ldquo the work of decades disappeared in a few hours  rdquo 
it could be much worse  his family survived and was able to flee when government forces moved in  and their gray and white cat emerged when they returned  meowing from hunger but otherwise unharmed 


few residents of eastern aleppo have been as fortunate  the city became the epicentre of syria rsquo s civil war when the rebels captured the eastern districts  starting with hanano  in the summer of      
the city has been fiercely contested since then  and earlier this year government forces fully besieged rebel held eastern aleppo  where nearly every hospital has been destroyed  and so many people have been killed that there are few places left to bury them 
the rebels are finally buckling under pressure  they have been retreating for more than a week  and while a prolonged battle is expected in the narrow streets of aleppo rsquo s old city  government forces are likely to prevail 
the loss of eastern aleppo would mark the greatest victory for president bashar assad rsquo s forces and his russian and iranian allies since the conflict began in      with peaceful protests against his family rsquo s four decade rule 


more than        people have fled aleppo since the latest government offensive began last month  joining the more than    million syrians  mdash  nearly half the population  mdash  who have fled their homes since the conflict began 
abdul ghani kassab  a senior official in the aleppo governorate  said     families have returned to hanano  which was home to tens of thousands before the conflict began  he said     of the buildings will have to be demolished because they cannot be renovated 


the syrian government and humanitarian agencies are providing aid to those who have returned  meeting them as they disembark from green government buses 
on sunday  volunteers with the syrian arab red crescent distributed mattresses  blankets  food baskets and diapers  they also handed out large sheets of plastic that could be used to cover smashed windows or doors  doctors standing outside ambulances diagnosed patients and prescribed medicine or vitamins 
one woman arrived with her husband  who was ill and could barely walk  he was forced to leave eastern aleppo yet again  this time rushed away in an ambulance to a hospital in the government held west
