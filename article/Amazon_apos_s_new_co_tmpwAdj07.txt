the       square foot store in downtown seattle  officially dubbed amazon go  is the latest foray in bricks and mortar retail by the e commerce giant  which already has bookstores  including one in san diego  nbsp and is working on drive through grocery locations 
it s a sign that seattle based amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the traditions of main street commerce 
in the much longer term  if the experiment works out and is adopted widely  it could radically transform the nature of work in the retail industry  much like self driving car and truck technology threatens to upend transportation 
the bureau of labor statistics said in a report this year that cashiers were the second largest occupation  with     million employed in the u s 
the amazon go store is open to amazon employees participating in a testing program  it is expected to be open to the public in early      
amazon says that what makes the store tick is a combination of computer vision  sensors and machine learning that it calls        just walk out technology

it can tell  say  when a particular shopper picks up a carton of milk from a physical shelf  the technology puts the milk in that shopper s virtual cart  it can also tell when an item is put back on the shelf         and removes it from the virtual cart accordingly 
shoppers walking into the store would call up the amazon go app and hold their smartphone to a scanner as they would at an airport  then they would pick up any combination of products and just walk out  amazon would charge them after they leave the store 
unlike the self serve registers present at many supermarkets  there s no need to stand in line or go through any register  the store features ready to eat meals and snacks prepared by on site chefs or local bakeries  there are also essentials such as bread and milk  as well as high end cheese and chocolate 
amazon says there will be well known brands as well as        special finds we re excited to introduce to customers         that includes an amazon meal kit  nbsp which contains ingredients needed to make a meal for two in    minutes
