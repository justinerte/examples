many times  washington nationals general manager mike rizzo has shuffled a few feet one way or another and reminded scrums of reporters about the dangers of standing with one   s back to the wall  he always smiles  but he never fails to move  so truth always glimmers through his joke  rizzo refuses to be cornered  spatially and otherwise  always looking for a way out  
so when facing a larger than normal media horde monday on the first day of baseball   s winter meetings  held a quick drive from nationals park  rizzo made sure to give himself a buffer between him and the nationals background propped up for the cameras on the   th floor of the gaylord national resort and convention center  
when asked about what his team will do now that former closer mark melancon rejected his nationals offer and signed with the san francisco giants  rizzo avoided specific alternatives but was adamant that his team has plenty 
   we   ve gotten a lot of good in house candidates  to close   we feel that we have a deep  talented bullpen     he said     but our adage over here is that you never have enough pitching  and the bullpen is something that we   re going to have to address    
the nationals chased melancon  enamored with his clubhouse presence and reliability  he took a four year deal worth      million from the giants  rizzo did not outline terms monday  but a person familiar with the nationals    dealings said they made a four year offer for less than      million  
   it   s just at the end of the day  the giants offered him more     rizzo said     and he took the deal    
no tears shed  no bridges burned     but no closer either  so now what  well  as usual  rizzo pointed to contingency plans  the nationals have    a lot of lines in the water     he said     a lot of irons in the fire    to improve  do any of those lines lead to an elite closer 
as has been well documented  three elite closers highlight this year   s free agent market  aroldis chapman  kenley jansen and melancon  the nationals were outbid for the cheapest of the three  
chapman reportedly wants a six year deal  and whether or not that is realistic  he seems likely to get significantly more than the      million plus melancon will make annually  jansen seems certain to get more  too     perhaps as much as      million per year  plus  the los angeles dodgers made jansen a qualifying offer  signing him not only requires exorbitant amounts but a first round draft pick  too  does the fact that they could not afford melancon mean the nationals are out of the running for the other two 
   we   re going to allocate our resources in the best way we possibly can  and if that   s a closer  that   s fine  if it   s another position  that   s fine     rizzo said     we   re going to give ourselves the best chance to get an impactful player at the right price and use our dollars the best way we can     
rizzo said at the beginning of the offseason that he planned to talk to chapman   s representatives  and he has spoken to jansen   s agent  too  the nationals have long liked chapman  a dusty baker favorite  and went so far as to do their own research on his domestic violence incident last offseason  but they would be bidding against titans such as the dodgers  the new york yankees and perhaps even the financially unpredictable miami marlins for both pitchers  the trade market could be more beneficial  
the nationals targeted kansas city closer wade davis  a free agent after the      season  at the trade deadline but eventually settled on melancon  in part because of concerns about davis   s health  the royals placed davis on the disabled list a few hours before the melancon deal became official  now healthy  davis could be an option for the nationals  who have plenty of prospect pieces at a variety of levels from which to deal  
reports suggest the marlins are pursuing one of the big three closers  though they have a hard throwing closer already in a j  ramos  should they sign chapman or jansen  perhaps ramos could become a possibility for the nationals  
the tampa bay rays are shopping several of their pitchers  according to reports  so their closer  alex colome  could fit  the chicago white sox seem willing to sell almost anyone  which would include closer david robertson  colome and robertson would likely not have the same game changing impact as jansen or chapman     but they would not require the same franchise altering investment  either  
similarly  the nationals scouted former royals closer greg holland  who missed last season after tommy john surgery  holland  a scott boras client  was throwing in the low   s at a well attended showcase for scouts last month  and one person familiar with his situation said the nationals have expressed interest  
holland would come with a lesser price tag than one of the big name closers but with higher risk  too  then again  the nationals do not shy away from pitchers who have had tommy john surgery and in fact have made a habit of finding value in them as other teams shy away  
former arizona diamondbacks closer brad ziegler and former texas rangers closer neftali feliz would be low cost free agents  likely more suited to bolster the seventh or eighth inning than the ninth  koda glover struggled in his first major league stint  but he was pitching through a hip injury until the nationals shut him down in mid september  glover  blake treinen  sammy solis and others are among those    in house candidates    to which rizzo referred
