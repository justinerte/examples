no  joe biden didn       t just announce a presidential run in       but as he       s learned from experience  you never say never 
       i       m not committing not to run  i m not committed to anything         the vice president told reporters at the capitol on monday night after attending a senate vote         i learned a long time ago    fate has a strange way of intervening        
biden might have run this year if not for fate intervening  he seriously weighed a candidacy in      as he and his family grieved the death of his eldest son  beau  who had brain cancer 
       the  grief  process doesn       t respect or much care about things like filing deadlines or debates and primaries and caucuses         he said last year as he announced he would not run  saying he didn t have enough time to mount a winning campaign 
but in that same speech  he rededicated himself to public service  among the causes he pledged to champion was a cure for cancer 
which is why biden was even talking to reporters monday at the capitol  in his constitutional role as president of the senate  he presided over consideration of legislation that includes      billion in funding for cancer research 
before senators approved the measure  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   announced a last minute amendment  to rename the cancer funding provisions in honor of beau biden 
       it       s fitting to dedicate this bill       s critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who       d be proud of the presiding officer today  and that       s his son         mcconnell said as biden watched  clearly moved  the vice president silently clasped his hands in front of him after the final change was approved  and the chamber applauded in his honor 
shortly after  biden was asked about running for president in four years         yeah  i am  i am going to run in              he said  asked whether he was serious  biden paused  before acknowledging the role of fate 
it will be an emotional few weeks for biden as he prepares to leave office  on wednesday  he ll return to the senate for a bipartisan tribute to his    years as a member of the body  as well as eight as vice president 
on dec      his family will again mark another tragic anniversary  of the car accident that killed his first wife and infant daughter just after biden won his first term in the senate in
