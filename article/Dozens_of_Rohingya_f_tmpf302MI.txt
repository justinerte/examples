dhaka  dozens are missing and feared drowned after a boat packed with rohingya fleeing violence in myanmar and trying to reach bangladesh sank in a border river on monday  reports and a bangladeshi fisherman said 
thousands of rohingya  a stateless ethnic minority  have arrived in bangladesh after an outbreak of violence in western myanmar  where the military is alleged to have committed mass rape and murder and burned villages 
a bangladeshi fisherman said he had rescued one woman who told him her  overcrowded  boat had sunk in the naf river after it was chased by a myanmar army speedboat 
 we heard a woman s desperate cry for help in the morning while we were fishing in the naf  we quickly paddled to the spot and saw she was fighting to stay afloat   fisherman suman das told afp by phone 
 the woman told us that their boat was overcrowded with rohingya villagers who tried to cross the river to enter bangladesh  
the woman did not know what had happened to the others and das could not say how many people were on the boat  but the private unb news agency  quoting a bangladeshi village councillor  said there were at least    rohingya on board 
a rohingya source told afp by phone that the bodies of    women and children  two of whom had bullet wounds  had washed ashore in his village on myanmar s side of the naf 
this could not be independently confirmed  however  and bangladesh police and border guards said they were not aware of the disaster  an estimated        rohingya have been forced to leave their homes since a bloody october crackdown by the myanmar army in rakhine state  where many of them live 
at least        have arrived in bangladesh  the united nations said last week  although bangladesh says it has prevented large numbers from entering 
myanmar has denied allegations of abuse  but has also banned foreign journalists and independent investigators from accessing the area to investigate
