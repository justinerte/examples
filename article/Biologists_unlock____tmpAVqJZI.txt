biologists unlock 51.7-million-year-old genetic secret to landmark darwin theory

darwin hypothesised that some plant species with two distinct forms of flower  where male and female reproductive organs were of differing lengths  had evolved that way to promote out crossing by insect pollinators 
his ground breaking insight into the significance of the two forms of flower known as  pins  and  thrums  coined the term  heterostyly   and subsequent studies contributed to the foundation of modern genetic theory 
and now scientists at the university of east anglia  working at the john innes centre  have identified exactly which part of these species  genetic code made them that way  through an event that occurred more than    million years ago 
prof philip gilmartin from uea s school of biological sciences said   to identify the genes which control the biology noted by darwin is an exciting moment  many studies have been done over the past decades to explore the genetic basis of this phenomenon but now we have pinpointed the supergene directly responsible  the s locus  
supergenes are clusters of closely associated genes which are always inherited together as a unit and allow complex biology to be controlled  researchers worked with the earlham institute to map the plant s genes and sequence the primula genome to find the specific gene cluster responsible for creating the differing flower morphs 
prof gilmartin said   not only did we identify the supergene but we found it is specific to just one of the flower forms  the thrum  this insight has profound implications for our understanding of a key evolutionary innovation of flowering plants 
 understanding of the genetics which underpin flower development and reproduction of a species broadens our knowledge about the entire system of pollination  which underpins biodiversity and food security 
 with challenges such as climate change and its effects on plants  crops and their insect pollinators  it s even more important to understand pollination mechanisms and how species can and will react 
in their hunt for the genes controlling heterostyly  researchers also managed to date the original mutation  to      million years ago 
having found the s locus  they realised the gene was a close relative to another  identified six years ago as responsible for controlling the identity of petals on a primula flower 
at some point this gene duplicated  inserted itself in the s locus  and mutated to control the position of the anther in the flower  finding this duplicated gene allowed the team to date how long ago the mutation occurred for the first time 
prof gilmartin has been researching the origins of heterostyly for a large part of his career  he said   this study answers some of the crucial questions that have been asked since darwin s time  and for me since i bought my first packet of primula seeds twenty years ago

scientists at the john innes centre have taken another crucial step towards understanding how plants initiate flowering 
although charles darwin is most well known both for his book  on the origin of species  and his theories on natural selection  he once stated   i do not think anything in my scientific life has given me so much satisfaction    
 phys org    an international team of researchers has identified the gene in petunia plants that is responsible for controlling how much uv light the flowers of the plant absorb which in turn has an impact on the types of    
the onset of flowering is a central event in the life cycle of a plant and ensures reproduction  from an agricultural perspective  it is important that flowering takes place at the right time to optimise harvests  professor    
tomato plants use similar biochemical mechanisms to reject pollen from their own flowers as well as pollen from foreign but related plant species  thus guarding against both inbreeding and cross species hybridization  report    
it remains unclear to scientists why almost every rna binding protein has a sibling   or  paralog   while such sibling proteins have the same origins and are similar to each other in a number of ways  they are presumed to    
throughout evolutionary history  there have been genetic elements that have duplicated   giving rise to genes with different functions  these are called  paralogs   they are able to form and evolve new functions  which have    
much like motors power our cars  they also ensure that proteins get to the right place in our cells  and a wide variety of diseases   from cancer to heart problems   can result when they don t
