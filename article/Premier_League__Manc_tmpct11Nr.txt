london  sergio aguero s four match suspension has been confirmed by the football association following his dismissal in manchester city s loss to chelsea 
city striker aguero was shown a red card for a dangerous two footed foul on chelsea defender david luiz  which led to a bust up between players and coaches from both teams in the final moments of saturday s premier league clash at eastlands 
the argentina international  who has scored    goals this season  will now miss league fixtures against leicester  watford  arsenal and hull 
aguero has already missed three games through suspension this term for elbowing west ham s winston reid and his latest absence is a major blow to city s title challenge 
fernandinho was also sent off for shoving cesc fabregas during the incident  with city s brazilian midfielder banned for three matches  as indicated on the disciplinary pages of the fa website on monday 
chelsea won the game     to move three points clear at the top  but both clubs may face fa disciplinary action for a failure to control their players 
fabregas  role in fernandinho s dismissal could also be scrutinised after it appeared he struck the city star in the face  prompting the brazil international s furious reaction
