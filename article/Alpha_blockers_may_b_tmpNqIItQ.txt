to help people get rid of large kidney stones  us researchers have promoted a non surgical way by suggesting off label use of drugs called alpha blockers that can facilitate stone passage  the study was published online in the british medical journal 
physicians are eager to find non surgical ways to help the two thirds of kidney stone patients who need more than just extra hydration to pass their stones 
contemporary practice guidelines recommend off label use of drugs called alpha blockers to facilitate stone passage  these include drugs such as such as tamsulosin  known as flomax 



however  a recent multicentre study of       subjects in the uk questioned the effectiveness of alpha blockers for this purpose 
now  a new review of the medical literature suggests alpha blockers may be useful in some cases 
 ldquo if we can facilitate kidney stone passage without surgery  it allows our patients to avoid extra pain and risks that come with a surgical procedure  rdquo  says first author john m hollingsworth from university of michigan medical school in the us 
hollingsworth and his team put that      study into the context of other kidney stone research  pooling a total of    randomized controlled trials comparing alpha blockers to placebo or control 
they then considered stone size and location in the       study subjects to see if either one was a factor in successfully passing the stone 
 ldquo we found alpha blockers were successful  but the benefit is primarily in patients with larger kidney stones  rdquo  says co author benjamin k canales  md  associate professor of urology at the university of florida college of medicine 
researchers reported a    percent higher risk of stone passage for larger stones with an alpha blocker  but no benefit for smaller stones  location did not make a difference  nor did type of alpha blocker used 

 ldquo this data helps me better identify the patients who are likely to benefit from alpha blockers  rdquo  hollingsworth says   ldquo it rsquo s important to consider stone size when deciding whether to recommend alpha blockers to kidney stone patients  rdquo 
because so many providers see kidney stones  from urologists like hollingsworth to emergency department physicians and primary care physicians  the treatment guidelines are especially important  he says 
 ldquo there had been a fair amount of ambiguity following the uk trial  however  our findings help solidify surrounding guideline recommendations on alpha blockers in patients with stones  rdquo  hollingsworth says
