it might not look out of place in a private gym     but for the various straps to keep the occupant in place and the hospital drip stand looming ominously behind  
pictured is the notorious restraint chair at guantanamo bay  where former inmates claim they were subjected to long hours of agonising forced feeding  
the us military is still using the chair to cope with a hunger strike by     of the     prisoners which has lasted more than three months 
 
each day  up to    of them are strapped down and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through a nasal tube 

but officials insist    enteral feeding    is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts 
 
 

 
a military spokesman said the feeding tubes are lubricated and prisoners are offered anaesthetic to prevent long lasting damage 
in april  the american medical association said force feeding detainees violated the profession   s    core ethical values
