aishwarya rai bachchan is trending on social media  but it is not because of her last hit karan johar s ae dil hai mushkil  neither it is because of her rumoured television debut as a judge of the singing reality show dil hai hindustani  no  it is not even because of  an appearance on koffee with karan season   
surprisingly  it is   because of her death  a death hoax of the actress has gone viral on social media and even blogs  inquisitr reports that rumours claiming the death of the stunning beauty flooded the social media and suggested that the cause of death was suicide 
india com reports that a blog even goes on to claim that rai committed suicide owing to marital woes  her steamy scenes with ranbir kapoor in ae dil hai muskil apparently enraged the bachchan family who began torturing her  succumbing to the grief and frustration  rai decided to end her life  according to one of the blogs 
there were several fans who gave in to the news of rai s death as they were being misled by multiple reports doing the rounds in the media about her alleged souring of relations with the bachchan family  there were many reports which suggested the same after rai was involved in a passionate on screen kiss with hrithik roshan in sanjay gadhvi s dhoom   
rai is not the first one to be on the receiving end of such death hoaxes  most notably it was her father amitabh bachchan who was the victim of a viral death hoax back in       along with him  several actors including dev anand  kadar khan and shashi kapoor have had their share of death hoaxes
